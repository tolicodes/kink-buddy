# Set your shell variables for Cloud Run below.

#

# It's recommended that you make a copy of the generated `.cloudconfig` to

# `cloudconfig`, if you don't want to commit the settings (`cloudconfig` is

# ignored by `.gitignore`).

#

# Run the following command to source these variables into your bash

# environment before running any of the npm scripts:

#

# source cloudconfig

# The Google Cloud project ID

export PROJECT=rational-autumn-417712

# The region for the deployed service

export REGION=us-east1

# The Cloud Run service name

export SERVICE=kinkbuddy
