 to creating a safe and welcoming space to facilitate new relationships\, e
 xploration\, and fulfillment of desires! Good vibes only — or else! \;)W
 ho Can AttendSAPPHICS (21+). If you do not fit the below definition\, plea
 se do not come. This is meant to be an intentional space for sapphics to m
 eet other sapphics. For everyone else\, there are other Pagans Paradise ev
 ents that you’ll love. Obviously\, enforcing this policy is tricky\, but
  we will trust attendees to respect our space and our intentions.(Definiti
 on from LGBTQIA+ Wiki) Sapphic\, sometimes known as women loving women (WL
 W)\,or sapphist\, refers to a woman or woman-aligned person of any sexual 
 orientation who is attracted to women or woman aligned genders/gender iden
 tities. We mean to be specifically inclusive of non-binary people. It is a
 n umbrella term for many identities\, including those who are lesbian\, pa
 nsexual\, bisexual\, or queer. It is used to promote solidarity among wome
 n and non-binary people of all identities who are attracted to those who a
 re women and woman-aligned. It may also be used as an identity\, and may b
 e found particularly useful for individuals who know they are attracted to
  women but may be uncertain if they are attracted to other genders. It can
  also be used to describe a relationship between two women.Ultimately\, we
  reserve the right to remove anyone\, sapphic or not\, for any reason - th
 is is usually a last resort consequence of a breach of our Community Guide
 lines. Please respect this privileged space and treat it as your own home.
 The Night will feature:Orientation: Nix\, our host\, will review guideline

 e dubbed this event as "Yoga for your Love Life"...Well\, now you know!FAQ
 Don't see your question answered below? Check out the FAQ on our website (
 bottom of page)!What is Tantra\, and why "Tantra" Speed Date?Forget those 
 wild myths and blockbuster misunderstandings\; Tantra is more about connec
 tion\, fun\, and being present than anything risqué. Imagine it as the ar
 t of "relationship yoga\," blending age-old practices with a twist of joy 
 and mindfulness. Through exercises like breathing\, meditating\, and maybe
  even a little dancing\, you'll find yourself more in tune with those arou
 nd you. It's like a social superpower for making genuine connections\, and
  trust us\, it's a blast! After all\, we find this level of presence is ex
 actly what's missing from most dating encounters today. Why just talk when
  you can laugh\, connect\, and explore together?What does this style of da
 ting look like?Picture this: You'll form two fun-filled circles of fellow 
 daters. The men make up the outer ring\, and the women form the inner ring
 \; so that you're paired off with a friendly face across from you. Togethe
 r\, you'll dive into engaging and heartfelt mini-dates (we call them 'dati
 ng stations') that last just long enough to spark a connection. After each
  experience\, you'll bring your hands into a cheerful 'Namaste'\, share a 
 quick thank you\, and then — whoosh! — off to the next exciting meetin
 g. Keep circling around\, and by the end\, you'll have met everyone.What k
 inds of exercises will I do?No clichéd icebreakers here! Our exercises ar
 e all about authentic human connection\, not cheesy romance. We're talking
  engaging dialogue\, light partner yoga\, movement/dance\, heartwarming ey
 e-gazing\, and even some gentle hand-holding. It's a delightful mix that g
 oes beyond the mundane 'what's your job' chatter.The coolest part? Every e
 xercise is wrapped around a positive relating skill. So\, not only will yo
 u have a blast\, you'll be building real relationship skills too! And reme
 mber consent\, you're the boss of how you participate. It's all about fun 
 and connection in a way that feels good for you.What if one of the exercis
 es is not my cup of tea?Thanks for asking! While the exercises are straigh
 tforward and fun\, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to parti
 cipate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you\, then--just lik
 e in yoga--you have the option to modify\, or completely opt out. Everyone
  is encouraged to participate at their own comfort level\, and our facilit
 ators do a fabulous job demonstrating what that looks like\, so it feels g
 ood for everyone.So how does this all add up to dating?Great question! Thi
 nk of it as a refreshing twist on the traditional dating scene. You'll get
  to interact\, laugh\, and connect with others\, and then decide who you'd
  like to get to know better. We put a fun spin on things by letting the la
 dies take the lead in choosing\; they'll place one of their beads in each 
 man's pouch that they want to connect with. They'll get a feel for the guy
 s' personalities and presence\, while the men are guided on how to be grou
 nded and open-hearted. Afterwards\, either party can contact the other. It
 's all about letting connections unfold naturally.What is the schedule?Doo
 rs Open: Right at the start time\, we'll check you in\, hand over your dat
 ing materials\, and give you a playing card for a super fun Ice Breaker ga
 me. You've got until the stations begin to mix and mingle!20 minutes in: T
 ime to let in folks from the waiting list\, making sure everything's balan
 ced and ready to roll.30 minutes in: Ice Breaker game wraps up\, and the d
 oors close. Now the real fun begins as we kick off the event. Be sure to c
 heck in before this time\, or you'll miss out on all the excitement! (Runn
 ing late or need to cancel? Check our policy below.)End of the Night: You'
 ll feel the warm glow of connection and may not want it to end. While we'l
 l gently nudge you toward the door\, it's common for guests to join togeth
 er for dinner\, continuing the connections and conversations. Who knows? Y
 our night might just be getting started!What should I wear?Think comfort w
 ith a touch of your best self! You'll be sitting and also moving\, so choo
 se an outfit that lets you feel relaxed but still sharp. Just remember\, i
 t's a date\, so grooming matters. And go easy on strong scents\; some peop
 le are sensitive.Is there food or drink at the event?We usually don't serv
 e food or drinks (unless it's a special event)\, so feel free to bring a w
 ater bottle. Snacks might be good for before or after\, but check with the
  venue\, as some don't allow food. As tempting as a quick bite during the 
 event might be\, you'll want all your attention on your dates. And remembe
 r\, alcohol is a no-go\, so please arrive with a clear and ready mind.How 
 many dates will I have?Get ready for a lively evening with up to 20 opport
 unities to connect! Our events typically max out at around 40 singles. Ass
 uming a balanced mix\, you'll have the chance to spark a connection with u
 p to 20 different people. And\, we're all about quality not quantity. You'
 ll find each moment meaningful as you dive into engaging exchanges with ot
 hers who\, just like you\, are looking to explore connection and authentic
 ity.What is the gender balance at the event?We don't believe in leaving an
 yone out of the fun\, so we do our best to aim for an equal gender balance
 . Of course\, it isn't always 100% under our control--even our matchmaking
  powers have their limits. But so far\, just about every event has been so
 ld out. And since we have an equal number of tickets per gender\, they've 
 all had a solid mix of singles ready to mingle! (We also occasionally use 
 door sales magic to balance the gender too.)What if I don't match with any
 one?As many of our attendees say\, "I don't even care if I match with anyo
 ne\, this was amazing!" That said\, we geek out on data. Our statistics sa
 y there is a 94.09% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if f
 or whatever reason the probability fails you\, we've got you covered. Your
  next ticket will be free!What is the age range?Some events have a suggest
 ed age range (noted in the title and description) and some are open to all
  ages. Whether you're a little outside the range or just curious about mee
 ting people within it\, you're welcome here.Our most popular events are op
 en to all ages\, drawing a vibrant and diverse crowd. Singles 30-45 tend t
 o be the largest group. Followed by folks 45+ and then 20s. And while age 
 might be a curiosity\, what truly sets our events apart is the connection 
 experience.But here's the thing. It's more than just about the dates. And 
 this is what makes Tantra Speed Date® unique. Singles everywhere rave abo
 ut how the experience itself can be quite transformative\, regardless of t
 heir matches. Why? Simply engaging consciously with other singles in a pos
 itive and structured way promotes more healthy relationships. And it just 
 plain feels good to connect with real people. You likely have never experi
 enced dating in such a fun and comfortable way. You'll gain confidence\, p
 ick up new skills\, and will likely start to attract more quality people i
 nto your life. That's what our participants say over and over again!Will t
 here be enough people?Don't let low RSVPs in one spot fool you. Our events
  often sell out faster than you can say "Namaste\," and often with a waiti
 ng list. We're keen to promote across various platforms\, and they don't a
 ll show the same love. Rest assured\, we make sure there's always a crowd 
 worth your while. So come on down\; your next amazing connection could be 
 just one RSVP away!Do I have to be single to attend?Ah\, the modern relati
 onship landscape—a tapestry of statuses! While you don't need to be 'sin
 gle' in the traditional sense\, you do need to be in a space where romanti
 c connections are possible. If you're already committed and not open to ne
 w love\, you may want to consider our couples events. But if you find your
  heart's door ajar\, even just a smidge—or if you're teetering on the ed
 ge of 'ready to date'—this could be the perfect space to explore what's 
 possible. Consider this your invitation to a playground of connection\, pe
 rfect for testing the waters!Is this a heterosexual event and is there a Q
 ueer/LGBTQ Tantra Speed Date?Diversity is the spice of life\, and we're co
 oking up all kinds of flavors! This classic version of Tantra Speed Date®
  is primarily designed for men-seeking-women and women-seeking-men. In thi
 s setup you'll find yourself in one of two gendered circles—one for men 
 and one for women. You'll rotate through up to 20 dates with members of th
 e opposite gender. But don't fret\, fabulous queer friends! We also host Q
 ueer Tantra Speed Date events in select cities. So if you're looking for a
  rainbow connection\, keep an eye on our website to see when we're bringin
 g that magic to a city near you!What is your cancellation/refund policy?We
  get it—life's a whirlwind! If you find yourself having to back out\, no
  worries. Here's the lowdown: cancel 24 hours or more ahead and you'll get
  a refund or transfer\, no fuss. If you're within that 24-hour window\, or
  fashionably late and miss the opening ceremony\, shoot us an email and we
 'll graciously "speed date" your ticket to the next event as a one-time co
 urtesy. So keep your plans as flexible as a yoga pose\, and communicate wi
 th us before the event kicks off. No refunds or transfers after the chimes
  ring and the magic starts!Can I sign up with my friend?Absolutely! We oft
 en have Bring-A-Friend ticket discounts! So thanks for sharing Tantra Spee
 d Date® with your friends! However\, do be sure to fill out their name an
 d their email address on the attendee form. Otherwise we will not be able 
 to check them in properly\, and they will not receive all the wonderful ma
 tches they'll make at the event. If we had a nickel for how many times you
 r friends email us wondering where their matches went... well\, you get th
 e picture. So please. Do your friends a solid and fill in their proper det
 ails.More Questions?Contact us at help@tantrany.com we'll be happy to tell

 vents are at a dedicated venue at Prime Produce Co-op and are graciously h
 osted by PLAN Gaming (https://www.plangaming.org/)\, which is a non-profit
  incubator. All people present in the space will specifically be there for
  this event\, so we can talk openly about kink and related topics.At Geeka
 holic\, we believe in making our events accessible to everyone\, so Geekah

 m I at the right place?The building is unmarked since it's an event space 
 and food co-op office normally (because hey\, New York). Come into 424 Wes
 t 54th Street and find our signup desk right at the entrance.🎭 What is 
 a Munch?A BDSM munch is a friendly\, social gathering of people interested
  in BDSM or kink. It is a good event for newcomers\, providing a safe spac
 e to learn\, socialize and establish a rapport within the kink community. 
 There is no nudity or sex\, just fellow kinksters talking (and playing gam
 es!) - feel free to dress comfortably. We focus on creating a welcoming en
 vironment for everyone!😨 I’m feeling nervous! I’ve never been to s
 omething like this.Don't hesitate to get in touch with us and let us know!

 ?Yes! Even though we have a cafe on premises\, you are welcome to bring an

 d at our events?“Cruising” involves either mass messaging attendees or
  attending events solely with the intent of soliciting casual sex or adver

 ondering why singles have dubbed this event as "Yoga for your Love Life"..
 .Well\, now you know!FAQDon't see your question answered below? Check out 
 the FAQ on our website (bottom of page)!What is Tantra\, and why "Tantra" 
 Speed Date?Forget those wild myths and blockbuster misunderstandings\; Tan
 tra is more about connection\, fun\, and being present than anything risqu
 é. Imagine it as the art of "relationship yoga\," blending age-old practi
 ces with a twist of joy and mindfulness. Through exercises like breathing\
 , meditating\, and maybe even a little dancing\, you'll find yourself more
  in tune with those around you. It's like a social superpower for making g
 enuine connections\, and trust us\, it's a blast! After all\, we find this
  level of presence is exactly what's missing from most dating encounters t
 oday. Why just talk when you can laugh\, connect\, and explore together?Wh
 at does this style of dating look like?Picture this: You'll form two fun-f
 illed circles of fellow daters. The men make up the outer ring\, and the w
 omen form the inner ring\; so that you're paired off with a friendly face 
 across from you. Together\, you'll dive into engaging and heartfelt mini-d
 ates (we call them 'dating stations') that last just long enough to spark 
 a connection. After each experience\, you'll bring your hands into a cheer
 ful 'Namaste'\, share a quick thank you\, and then — whoosh! — off to 
 the next exciting meeting. Keep circling around\, and by the end\, you'll 
 have met everyone.What kinds of exercises will I do?No clichéd icebreaker
 s here! Our exercises are all about authentic human connection\, not chees
 y romance. We're talking engaging dialogue\, light partner yoga\, movement
 /dance\, heartwarming eye-gazing\, and even some gentle hand-holding. It's
  a delightful mix that goes beyond the mundane 'what's your job' chatter.T
 he coolest part? Every exercise is wrapped around a positive relating skil
 l. So\, not only will you have a blast\, you'll be building real relations
 hip skills too! And remember consent\, you're the boss of how you particip
 ate. It's all about fun and connection in a way that feels good for you.Wh
 at if one of the exercises is not my cup of tea?Thanks for asking! While t
 he exercises are straightforward and fun\, you are always 100% at choice f
 or how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work 
 for you\, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify\, or comp
 letely opt out. Everyone is encouraged to participate at their own comfort
  level\, and our facilitators do a fabulous job demonstrating what that lo
 oks like\, so it feels good for everyone.So how does this all add up to da
 ting?Great question! Think of it as a refreshing twist on the traditional 
 dating scene. You'll get to interact\, laugh\, and connect with others\, a
 nd then decide who you'd like to get to know better. We put a fun spin on 
 things by letting the ladies take the lead in choosing\; they'll place one
  of their beads in each man's pouch that they want to connect with. They'l
 l get a feel for the guys' personalities and presence\, while the men are 
 guided on how to be grounded and open-hearted. Afterwards\, either party c
 an contact the other. It's all about letting connections unfold naturally.
 What is the schedule?Doors Open: Right at the start time\, we'll check you
  in\, hand over your dating materials\, and give you a playing card for a 
 super fun Ice Breaker game. You've got until the stations begin to mix and
  mingle!20 minutes in: Time to let in folks from the waiting list\, making
  sure everything's balanced and ready to roll.30 minutes in: Ice Breaker g
 ame wraps up\, and the doors close. Now the real fun begins as we kick off
  the event. Be sure to check in before this time\, or you'll miss out on a
 ll the excitement! (Running late or need to cancel? Check our policy below
 .)End of the Night: You'll feel the warm glow of connection and may not wa
 nt it to end. While we'll gently nudge you toward the door\, it's common f
 or guests to join together for dinner\, continuing the connections and con
 versations. Who knows? Your night might just be getting started!What shoul
 d I wear?Think comfort with a touch of your best self! You'll be sitting a
 nd also moving\, so choose an outfit that lets you feel relaxed but still 
 sharp. Just remember\, it's a date\, so grooming matters. And go easy on s
 trong scents\; some people are sensitive.Is there food or drink at the eve
 nt?We usually don't serve food or drinks (unless it's a special event)\, s
 o feel free to bring a water bottle. Snacks might be good for before or af
 ter\, but check with the venue\, as some don't allow food. As tempting as 
 a quick bite during the event might be\, you'll want all your attention on
  your dates. And remember\, alcohol is a no-go\, so please arrive with a c
 lear and ready mind.How many dates will I have?Get ready for a lively even
 ing with up to 20 opportunities to connect! Our events typically max out a
 t around 40 singles. Assuming a balanced mix\, you'll have the chance to s
 park a connection with up to 20 different people. And\, we're all about qu
 ality not quantity. You'll find each moment meaningful as you dive into en
 gaging exchanges with others who\, just like you\, are looking to explore 
 connection and authenticity.What is the gender balance at the event?We don
 't believe in leaving anyone out of the fun\, so we do our best to aim for
  an equal gender balance. Of course\, it isn't always 100% under our contr
 ol--even our matchmaking powers have their limits. But so far\, just about
  every event has been sold out. And since we have an equal number of ticke
 ts per gender\, they've all had a solid mix of singles ready to mingle! (W
 e also occasionally use door sales magic to balance the gender too.)What i
 f I don't match with anyone?As many of our attendees say\, "I don't even c
 are if I match with anyone\, this was amazing!" That said\, we geek out on
  data. Our statistics say there is a 94.09% chance you'll match with AT LE
 AST one person. But if for whatever reason the probability fails you\, we'
 ve got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!What is the age range?So
 me events have a suggested age range (noted in the title and description) 
 and some are open to all ages. Whether you're a little outside the range o
 r just curious about meeting people within it\, you're welcome here.Our mo
 st popular events are open to all ages\, drawing a vibrant and diverse cro
 wd. Singles 30-45 tend to be the largest group. Followed by folks 45+ and 
 then 20s. And while age might be a curiosity\, what truly sets our events 
 apart is the connection experience.But here's the thing. It's more than ju
 st about the dates. And this is what makes Tantra Speed Date® unique. Sin
 gles everywhere rave about how the experience itself can be quite transfor
 mative\, regardless of their matches. Why? Simply engaging consciously wit
 h other singles in a positive and structured way promotes more healthy rel
 ationships. And it just plain feels good to connect with real people. You 
 likely have never experienced dating in such a fun and comfortable way. Yo
 u'll gain confidence\, pick up new skills\, and will likely start to attra
 ct more quality people into your life. That's what our participants say ov
 er and over again!Will there be enough people?Don't let low RSVPs in one s
 pot fool you. Our events often sell out faster than you can say "Namaste\,
 " and often with a waiting list. We're keen to promote across various plat
 forms\, and they don't all show the same love. Rest assured\, we make sure
  there's always a crowd worth your while. So come on down\; your next amaz
 ing connection could be just one RSVP away!Do I have to be single to atten
 d?Ah\, the modern relationship landscape—a tapestry of statuses! While y
 ou don't need to be 'single' in the traditional sense\, you do need to be 
 in a space where romantic connections are possible. If you're already comm
 itted and not open to new love\, you may want to consider our couples even
 ts. But if you find your heart's door ajar\, even just a smidge—or if yo
 u're teetering on the edge of 'ready to date'—this could be the perfect 
 space to explore what's possible. Consider this your invitation to a playg
 round of connection\, perfect for testing the waters!Is this a heterosexua
 l event and is there a Queer/LGBTQ Tantra Speed Date?Diversity is the spic
 e of life\, and we're cooking up all kinds of flavors! This classic versio
 n of Tantra Speed Date® is primarily designed for men-seeking-women and w
 omen-seeking-men. In this setup you'll find yourself in one of two gendere
 d circles—one for men and one for women. You'll rotate through up to 20 
 dates with members of the opposite gender. But don't fret\, fabulous queer
  friends! We also host Queer Tantra Speed Date events in select cities. So
  if you're looking for a rainbow connection\, keep an eye on our website t
 o see when we're bringing that magic to a city near you!What is your cance
 llation/refund policy?We get it—life's a whirlwind! If you find yourself
  having to back out\, no worries. Here's the lowdown: cancel 24 hours or m
 ore ahead and you'll get a refund or transfer\, no fuss. If you're within 
 that 24-hour window\, or fashionably late and miss the opening ceremony\, 
 shoot us an email and we'll graciously "speed date" your ticket to the nex
 t event as a one-time courtesy. So keep your plans as flexible as a yoga p
 ose\, and communicate with us before the event kicks off. No refunds or tr
 ansfers after the chimes ring and the magic starts!Can I sign up with my f
 riend?Absolutely! We often have Bring-A-Friend ticket discounts! So thanks
  for sharing Tantra Speed Date® with your friends! However\, do be sure t
 o fill out their name and their email address on the attendee form. Otherw

 o you want a taste of Classical Tantra with elements from India?Monique Da
 rling and Peter Petersen invite you to the Art of Adoration Ceremony. A be
 autiful and sacred ancient ritual that has been practiced for thousands of
  years.It is a beautiful ceremony of honoring and adoring the Divine that 
 dwells within each of us\, and brings us into a profound space of connecti
 on and universal Love.This experience welcomes everyone\, all faiths\, and
  orientations.View the image gallery under the Discussion tab to get an id
 ea what the experience will be like. (Pics and Videos from the last one)St
 ep into a world of acceptance and sensation where all of you is welcome. E
 ach person is invited into magical connections to expand your experience/c
 apacity of giving and receiving. The ritual begins the moment you enter as
  you are celebrated\, seen and adored for ALL you are.This evening’s cer
 emony is dedicated to all genders. In fact\, participants will not know wh
 ether they will be in the giving or receiving role until they arrive. We w
 ill use movement\, sound and the five elements\, all given to us with ampl
 e instruction\, enriching each experience throughout the evening. You may 
 find yourself turning inwards and becoming aware of abundant love and inna
 te beauty that is part of your being.This ceremony opens people's hearts i
 n a way that allows them to see the inner beauty and the Divine within us 
 all. The participants in the giving role will be instructed in performing 
 an ancient ritual\, which is simple in form yet very powerful in practice.
  As the participants in the receiving role accept the offerings and adorat
 ion\, they in turn connect with unconditional love and reflect that adorat
 ion back to the givers with their presence. Taking part in these rituals i
 s a very powerful way to reconnect and relate with all aspects of ourselve
 s. It is through the practice of unconditional loving that we find that an
 y emptiness or longing we feel within us can be filled with a simple act o
 f giving.This ancient ritual is thousands of years old. It was brought to 
 life by those who implemented the practice of breathing life and awareness
  through the five elements (Earth\, Water\, Fire\, Air\, Ether) in offerin
 g to the divine within every living being. We will offer fire\, incense\, 
 roses\, water\, chocolate and more in adoration and worship of our divine 
 essence.We welcome you to reclaim your space and powerful place in the wor
 ld as we unveil your deepest core. You will leave enchanted having fallen 
 more deeply in love with YOU.With open hearts and deep connection you will
  be "rebirthed" from a place of complete vulnerability and fullness as you
  choose to wake up to YOU!This is a non-sxxual experience and welcomes eve

 onique Rope play has the capacity to empower and inspire both the giver an
 d the receiverRSVP to save your spot:Unravel. Surrender. Receive."To tie i
 s to embrace." - Arisue GoRope play is a form of sensual bondage. It is an
  art of connection and seduction\, surrender and control\, with both ancie
 nt roots and modern techniques. Rope play has the capacity to empower and 
 inspire both the giver and the receiver. For the one bound in rope it can 
 at times be paradoxically a very relaxing experience\, not unlike swaddlin
 g a small baby. At other times being bound\, tied\, and released can flood
  the body with endorphins and adrenaline creating highly charged\, ecstati
 c states. For the one doing the tying\, rope becomes an extension of his o
 r her hands. It is possible to create almost an infinite number of sensati
 ons with rope\, from slow and sensual\, to rough and biting. By cultivatin
 g energetic flow states\, a deep sense of connection can develop between r
 ope play partners.Intimate LEADERSHIP &amp\; empowered SURRENDER:an introd
 uctory rope and energy play class.It is a small group workshop created for
  participants desiring a safe and welcoming introduction to ropes while ex
 ploring their emotional edges and learning how to confidently take and sur
 render control.In the process\, participants will learn about themselves t
 hrough connection to their deepest and most vulnerable core. After all\, i
 t is only by releasing control that we can unleash our full potential\, an
 d only by stepping into our power can we invite another to give up theirs.
 Through a combination of tantric practices\, sacred sxxuality\, and consen
 t- and trauma-informed coaching\, this shibari and energetic journey will 
 guide you into an altered state of consciousness that allows for your deep
 est transformation in confidence\, self-acceptance\, and sensual expressio
 n.Rina will teach a simple\, but deceptively powerful style of rope play t
 hat require no knowledge of complicated knots. She’ll guide you through 
 the basics of rope safety. She and Monique will offer simple techniques fo
 r using rope to cultivate energy and power exchange between consenting adu
 lts. Our focus is on using rope as a tool for helping partners develop emo
 tional connection\, intimacy\, and trust.No prior rope play experience is 
 required. Basic energy play or power exchange experience is helpful\, but 
 not necessary. Couples and singles of all genders and orientations are wel
 comed. Uncoupled singles will be paired with other singles. Each participa
 nt will learn to tie and be tied. Rope and mats will be provided for those
  who don’t already have them.You'll learn from two world-class practitio
 ners one\, former pro-domme\, and the second a tantrika that has led over 
 3\,000 workshops around the world. When you leave\, hopefully you will hav
 e gained greater access to energy\, surrender\, play\, and also will have 
 gained the skills to practice shibari confidently\, safely\, and with a gr
 eater awareness of your and your partner's emotional needs in intimacy.Lov
