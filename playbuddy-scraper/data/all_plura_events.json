Come for the workshop and stay for the Jam to practice what you learned and meet other like-minded folks!_**\n\nIn **ROPE WITH ROB**, we focus on strengthening your fundamentals, giving you the foundation to explore the versatility of rope. Whether you're a beginner or intermediate, this four-week series will help you build confidence in your skills and open up new possibilities for your play. Rope is more than just a tool—it's a medium for creating art, exploring intimacy, embracing peace, or pushing boundaries through sensation and control.\n\nAs we progress through each workshop, you'll discover how the fundamentals of rope can be adapted to suit a wide range of styles, from the decorative to the intense. Come ready to learn, tie, and experiment in a supportive environment.\n\n**WEEK FOUR: Rope Art (Sep 30)**\n\n*   **Rope as a Medium of Expression**: Transform rope into a visual and tactile art form, exploring decorative ties and body harnesses that blend function with beauty.\n*   **Harnessing Creativity**: Learn techniques to create intricate designs that balance aesthetics with comfort.\n*   **Showcasing Your Work**: Tips on posing your partner, staging, and presenting your rope art in a visually captivating way.\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all gender identifications, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. \n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm. Please be on time and text ahead if you are delayed. \n*   You are welcome to wear a mask throughout the duration of the event.\n*   We encourage all to engage chat via Plura before/after the event!\n\n#### Jam After the Workshop:\n\nStick around for our jam session, exclusively open to workshop participants. During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Rob will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n● **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n● **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\n_Required Disclaimer: It should go without saying, but we are going to spell it out clearly nonetheless: kink activities are inherently risky and safety is something that requires practice and cannot be guaranteed. By attending, you agree to participate at your own risk, conduct your own risk management, and agree to hold the event facilitators and facility harmless for any type of harm that may occur._\n\nAny questions or concerns email PagansParadiseNYC@gmail.com\n\nPagansParadise.com IG: @pagansparadise",

Whether your goal in building a connection with someone is romantic or not, having the ability to present yourself in a charming and confident way is a major component to your success.\n\n**In this workshop, we will provide you with the skills/information to achieve this through:**\n\n*   Live feedback and support from a dating coach and pro dom.\n*   Mindfulness and meditation techniques to ground yourself in your body and the current moment.\n*   A detailed layout on what constitutes a successful interaction.\n*   Live demonstration on how to approach someone of interest.\n*   An opportunity to practice your “rizz” in a judgment free, safe space.\n\n**What this is not:**\n\nThis is not a class on “pick-up artistry”. This workshop is intended to explore and utilize effective social skills in order to uncover mutual desire and build a genuine connection.\n\nThis is not a lecture. While many wonderful classes share very important information on what to say in social situations and how to say them, we will go beyond information sharing by giving you the tools you need to feel confident, worthy, and charismatic enough to interact with ANY person you are interested in meeting.\n\n**Who is this for?**\n\nThe workshop is all-inclusive and open to all genders and orientations. It is intended for anyone looking to start a healthy interaction with a person of interest on any social platform, whether it be online, in a bar, at a party, social event etc.\n\n**You will want to attend this workshop if you have ever asked yourself:**\n\n*   How do I start a conversation with a new person?\n*   How can I be more confident in my approach?\n*   What can I do to be more engaging?\n*   Has my personal energy (Potential Desperate D\\*ck/Predatory P\\*ssy energy) been off putting to others and not well received?\n\n**Is this a Solo or Partnered act/experience?**\n\nThere will be moments throughout the workshop where we will invite you to pair up with someone to practice some of the material. All activities and exercise are completely voluntary so if you wish to not pair up that is more than fine.\n\n**The Workshop Experience:** This is an in-person workshop in a beautiful and private studio space in Koreatown (near Herald Square). The workshop will include 2.5 hours of discussion & instruction where you will be able to receive and explore new techniques and positions. If you desire, you may receive hands-on practice and demonstration.\n\nNOTE: _We will focus heavily on creating a container that pushes safety and personal agency. We will not tolerate anyone who comes to the space to make others feel uncomfortable or create harm._\n\n**Workshop Tickets: Early Bird $30, Classic $40**\n\nThis event is perfect and open for all experience levels.18+ for workshops. Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. Doors open at 7pm and closes at 7:15 pm please be on time.\n\nAny questions or concerns email [PagansParadiseNYC@gmail.com](mailto:PagansParadiseNYC@gmail.com)\n\nTartaruscoaching.com\n\nPagansParadise.com\n\nDaddyRetreat.com",

    "description": "Join HMU and Open Social for a workshop - Developing Non-Monogamous Relationship Agreements - followed by a mixer!\n\n**About the Event**\n\nWhether you’re exploring sexual connections, kink dynamics, or full-blown intimate partnerships, non-monogamy creates exciting opportunities not accessible in traditional relationships. It also comes with challenges: considering the needs and desires of multiple people simultaneously is no easy task. How do you balance the need for security with the need for privacy and autonomy? What if exploring shared desires with one connection conflicts with the boundaries of another?\n\nThis workshop is designed for anyone practicing non-monogamy who is interested in establishing a set of guidelines or “agreements” with existing partners that can be used as a roadmap while you navigate new experiences.\n\nUsing a questionnaire, we’ll identify each partner’s individual intentions, needs, and desires. From these, we’ll develop a set of agreements that allow each partner to have many of their needs and desires met, while respecting and honoring their partner’s boundaries.\n\nWe’ll address common pitfalls and demonstrate effective communication strategies for working through conflicts as they arise. We'll also review strategies for finding new non-monogamous connections that align with the agreements you’ve established with your existing partners.\n\nThe workshop will be followed by a mixer to give all our lovely participants an opportunity to connect with other like-minded non-monogamous individuals who wish to explore new connections with intention and consideration.\n\nParticipants will walk away with copies of the relationship agreements questionnaire and the non-escalator relationship menu. All attendees will also receive coupons for non-monogamy coaching sessions with your facilitator, Alissa Silverstein, LCSW at an exclusive rate of $125 per session (over 50% discount) with ALL proceeds going to Open Social. This workshop is offered during Open Social’s October fundraising month and 50% of proceeds from tickets as well as the coaching sessions will help support Open Social in 2025.\n\n**NOTE**: you are welcome to come with a partner/s or solo\n\n**About the Facilitator**\n\nAlissa Silverstein, LCSW is a licensed psychotherapist and coach who specializes in working with queer, kinky, and non-monogamous clients. Alissa is an organizer of Open Social, a grassroots nonprofit community for explorers of non-monogamy that prioritizes platonic connection.\n\n**STAY IN TOUCH!**\n\nInstagram [@hitmeupnycity](http://www.hitmeupnyc.com/hitmeupnycity)\n\nJoin our [public newsletter](https://www.hitmeupnyc.com/newsletter)\n\n✨Volunteers: Limited volunteer spots available.

    "description": "### Workshop: KINK TOUR \n\n> Embark on the **KINK TOUR**, your passport to exploring a world of desires, sensations, and play styles. This series is your guided journey through the basics of kink—think of it as a sightseeing trip through pleasure, where every workshop is a new destination. Whether you're just getting your first taste or you're an experienced traveler in the world of kink, you'll find something here to expand your horizons.\n\n> This tour is about sampling what’s out there, enough to give you a feel for different styles in a controlled, safe(r) environment. New to a particular kink? Get a guided introduction and try it on. Already familiar? Heighten your experience with deeper safety practices and improve your techniques. Wherever you are on your journey, this tour is designed to inspire, educate, and elevate your play. Enjoy the ride!\n\n#### Week Three: Objectification (Oct 2)\n\n*   **Types of Objectification:** Explore various forms of turning from a human to an “it”, from furniture to dollification. \n*   **Psychological Aspects of Objectification:** What attracts people to wanting to become an object? How do you navigate the emotions that might arise with this type of play?\n*   **Setting Boundaries and Intentions:** The better you negotiate and plan, the more you’ll be able to surrender and enjoy the dynamic.\n\n((Come to all four workshops or drop in for just one! ))\n\n—-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all genders, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles, and couples.

During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Nix & Rrrob will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Workshop 7:30-9:30 pm - Jam 9:45pm-11:45pm\n\n#### _Near Herald Square / Address given in confirmation email additional info / Elevator Access available at this location_\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n● **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n● **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\nSAVE WHEN YOU GO TO ALL FOUR: Workshops $140 or Workshop + Jams $260\n\n> KINK TOUR: Fall Series (Wednesdays @ Herald Square)\n\n> Breathplay (Sep 18th)\n\n> Primal Play (Sep 25th)\n\n> Objectification (Oct 2nd)\n\n> Watching Them With Someone Else (Oct 9th)",

    "description": "### Workshop: POWER PLAY | Power Dynamics 101\n\n**Hosted by Nix (the Sirenatrix)**\n\n> This transformative edu-series on Power - designed for Dom(mes), subs, and switches - who wish to gain a deeper understanding of influence and surrender. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned veteran, this workshop will enhance your skills and scenes - and perhaps even your perspective.\n\n> This series of workshops will likely change the way you view power exchange, giving you a new appreciation for the intimacy involved in influence. Raising your voice in a domineering way isn’t the same as influencing your sub with a single whisper—true power tends to be subtle, grounded, intentional, and deeply connected. In **POWER PLAY**, you’ll learn how to get someone’s entire mind, body, and soul on board with your desires. You’ll learn to play with resistance, use your physicality, and make your presence felt down to the core. Every session will delve into a different facet of power dynamics. Embrace your role, refine your tools, and discover the depths of power exchange in a supportive educational environment.\n\n#### Power Dynamics 101 (Oct 3rd)\n\n*   **The Fundamentals of Power**: Explore the (surprising) three ingredients of Power.\n*   **Harness What You’ve Got, Don’t Pretend:** You’ll learn how to connect to your unique internal source - because only authenticity will work.\n*   **Reading Power Dynamics**: Discover how to identify and work with power dynamics in a scene.\n\n((Come to all four workshops or drop in for just one! ))\n\n—-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow.

Address provided after ticket purchase.\n\nDate and Time\n\nFri, Oct 4th at 7:00 PM to 11:45 PM. Doors will open at 7:00 PM and close at 7:30 PM. BE ON TIME as nobody will be admitted after the doors close to preserve the sanctity of the container we create. Everyone must be present for the opening circle. You may leave at any time. There will be an optional closing circle around 11:00 PM.\n\nLight snacks will be provided. This is a clean and sober event.\n\nCovid-19 Policies\n\nPlease do not attend if you have any symptoms. All attendees are encouraged to be fully vaccinated. Please only attend if you are okay with being in a group of people indoors, regardless of their personal health choices or decisions to wear masks.\n\nWhat is a Temple Party?\n\nWe believe our bodies are sacred spaces and any time we dive into our deeper levels of consciousness and connect in ways that ignite our spirits, this is a sacred practice. Boundaries and consent are foremost, and we will provide guidelines for everyone to engage and still feel safe.\n\nA Temple Party is an opportunity to grow spiritually, play, explore, connect with people, and most of all to have fun. You might just want to observe (observing is a valid form of participation), or you might want to share light touch and cuddling or healing massage. You get to decide what you want to do, and you do not have to do anything you are uncomfortable with. You do not have to touch or interact with anyone unless you want to. All activities must be safe, sane and consensual, and within the boundaries we have set.\n\nWe adhere to common community guidelines and do not allow inappropriate behavior.\n\nWho Should Attend?\n\nAll persons 21 or older regardless of orientation, race, ability or religion. If you are open-minded and interested in sharing loving touch, we welcome you. If you are just curious but don’t want to play, you are welcome to come experience the atmosphere. Nobody will touch you without your verbal consent.\n\nWe expect everyone who attends to be able to abide by our guidelines and respect boundaries. Attendees should be able to communicate clearly with others and know their own limitations. We expect a level of emotional maturity and spiritual awareness that will allow you to function in a group setting.\n\nWhat to Wear\n\nDress in something comfortable! You will want to wear something you can easily move around in. Shoes will be left at the door.\n\nPlease do not use any scented products or perfumes before coming to the party to respect those with sensitivities to fragrance.\n\nWhat to Bring\n\nWe will have an area set aside for your belongings. Bring a water bottle (only closed-lid bottles containing water will be allowed in the play areas).\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nThis will be a relaxed, playful event. We will have an opening circle where we establish our container for the evening. We will review guidelines and discuss boundaries, followed by a brief ice-breaker activity. After that you will be free to explore on your own. Facilitators will be available to help guide your spiritual practices and ensure everyone stays within the boundaries we have set.\n\nExpect to have a fun evening and connect with some like-minded individuals. You get to decide how to participate. This is a safe space where participants are encouraged to explore themselves and others in ways that are spiritual, healthy, stimulating, nurturing, exciting, safe, consensual and fun!",

    "description": "#### A weekend intensive on the foundations of rope play through the lens of embodiment and intentionality.\n\n#### _Our intro class Rope 0 is a prerequisite to this class._\n\n**A weekend long intensive on October 5th and 6th**\n\n**10/5 and 10/6 from 12-5pm**\n\nThese classes will cover:\n\n*   Basic tension, frictions, and knots with some fundamental skills and drills; \n*   Somatics for rope; \n*   Body handling and affective rope skills;\n*   Floor-based predicaments. \n\nJoin Mrghy and friends on this journey to begin an intentional, body-based, connective rope practice. While some time will be spent on rope handling techniques, this series will focus on both ends of the rope, to serve both folks giving and receiving it. Switching is welcome but not necessary!\n\nEach session will include a discussion, a short demo, and plenty of practice time.\n\nIn order to promote continuity of learning and community trust, we’d like to have a max of 10 pairs for the whole series. Drop-ins will NOT be available for these, and registered pairs should remain the same throughout (learning buddies are the best!).\n\nSnacks and non-alcoholic drinks are welcome, and any comfortable outfit you like to move in. We will have some jute rope to use for practice, but we encourage you to bring your own (so you can practice at home between sessions!). 2-3 pieces will suffice, any material is welcome.\n\nMrghy has been working on embodiment in and out of rope for two decades. Rope has been a friend for almost 10 years, and a fundamental practice for the past 3. She brings her expertise in embodiment, somatics, trauma-informed practices, and mindfulness to the experience of rope as mainly a bottom and more recently as a learning rigger. She is passionate about sharing information about trauma, pain science, and vulnerable conditions such as hypermobility, neurodivergence, and addiction with communities of all kinds, and those involved in shibari, kink, and BDSM in particular. She co-founded Temple in Bushwick in 2019.\n\n#### Must take all days: 10/5 and 10/6 12-5pm\n\n### [RSVP](https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=27853603&appointmentType=50275734) is $280 per tying pair for the 2 sessions\n\n#### If the event is sold out, you can sign up for a [WAITLIST HERE](https://forms.gle/r4beaT43sK8jxua8A)\n\n_CANCELLATION POLICY: you can reschedule once or ask for a refund up to 48 hours before the event. A processing fee of 5% will be subtracted from all refunds. No refunds will be issued with less than 48 hours notice._",

Check out the [FAQ on our website](https://tantrany.com/speed-dating/?aff=4ebfaq) (bottom of page)!\n\n### What is Tantra, and why \"Tantra\" Speed Date?\n\nForget those wild myths and blockbuster misunderstandings; Tantra is more about connection, fun, and being present than anything risqué. Imagine it as the art of \"relationship yoga,\" blending age-old practices with a twist of joy and mindfulness. Through exercises like breathing, meditating, and maybe even a little dancing, you'll find yourself more in tune with those around you. It's like a social superpower for making genuine connections, and trust us, it's a blast! After all, we find this level of presence is exactly what's missing from most dating encounters today. Why just talk when you can laugh, connect, and explore together?\n\n### What does this style of dating look like?\n\nPicture this: You'll form two fun-filled circles of fellow daters. The men make up the outer ring, and the women form the inner ring; so that you're paired off with a friendly face across from you. Together, you'll dive into engaging and heartfelt mini-dates (we call them 'dating stations') that last just long enough to spark a connection. After each experience, you'll bring your hands into a cheerful 'Namaste', share a quick thank you, and then — whoosh! — off to the next exciting meeting. Keep circling around, and by the end, you'll have met everyone.\n\n### What kinds of exercises will I do?\n\nNo clichéd icebreakers here! Our exercises are all about authentic human connection, not cheesy romance. We're talking engaging dialogue, light partner yoga, movement/dance, heartwarming eye-gazing, and even some gentle hand-holding. It's a delightful mix that goes beyond the mundane 'what's your job' chatter.\n\nThe coolest part? Every exercise is wrapped around a positive relating skill. So, not only will you have a blast, you'll be building real relationship skills too! And remember consent, you're the boss of how you participate. It's all about fun and connection in a way that feels good for you.\n\n### What if one of the exercises is not my cup of tea?\n\nThanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify, or completely opt out. Everyone is encouraged to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators do a fabulous job demonstrating what that looks like, so it feels good for everyone.\n\n### So how does this all add up to dating?\n\nGreat question! Think of it as a refreshing twist on the traditional dating scene. You'll get to interact, laugh, and connect with others, and then decide who you'd like to get to know better. We put a fun spin on things by letting the ladies take the lead in choosing; they'll place one of their beads in each man's pouch that they want to connect with. They'll get a feel for the guys' personalities and presence, while the men are guided on how to be grounded and open-hearted. Afterwards, either party can contact the other. It's all about letting connections unfold naturally.\n\n### What is the schedule?\n\n*   **Doors Open**: Right at the start time, we'll check you in, hand over your dating materials, and give you a playing card for a super fun Ice Breaker game. You've got until the stations begin to mix and mingle!\n*   **20 minutes in**: Time to let in folks from the waiting list, making sure everything's balanced and ready to roll.\n*   **30 minutes in**: Ice Breaker game wraps up, and the doors close. Now the real fun begins as we kick off the event. Be sure to check in before this time, or you'll miss out on all the excitement! (Running late or need to cancel? Check our policy below.)\n*   **End of the Night**: You'll feel the warm glow of connection and may not want it to end. While we'll gently nudge you toward the door, it's common for guests to join together for dinner, continuing the connections and conversations. Who knows? Your night might just be getting started!\n\n### What should I wear?\n\nThink comfort with a touch of your best self! You'll be sitting and also moving, so choose an outfit that lets you feel relaxed but still sharp. Just remember, it's a date, so grooming matters. And go easy on strong scents; some people are sensitive.\n\n### Is there food or drink at the event?\n\nWe usually don't serve food or drinks (unless it's a special event), so feel free to bring a water bottle. Snacks might be good for before or after, but check with the venue, as some don't allow food. As tempting as a quick bite during the event might be, you'll want all your attention on your dates. And remember, alcohol is a no-go, so please arrive with a clear and ready mind.\n\n### How many dates will I have?\n\nGet ready for a lively evening with up to 20 opportunities to connect! Our events typically max out at around 40 singles. Assuming a balanced mix, you'll have the chance to spark a connection with up to 20 different people. And, we're all about quality not quantity. You'll find each moment meaningful as you dive into engaging exchanges with others who, just like you, are looking to explore connection and authenticity.\n\n### What is the gender balance at the event?\n\nWe don't believe in leaving anyone out of the fun, so we do our best to aim for an equal gender balance. Of course, it isn't always 100% under our control--even our matchmaking powers have their limits. But so far, just about every event has been sold out. And since we have an equal number of tickets per gender, they've all had a solid mix of singles ready to mingle! (We also occasionally use door sales magic to balance the gender too.)\n\n### What if I don't match with anyone?\n\nAs many of our attendees say, \"I don't even care if I match with anyone, this was amazing!\" That said, we geek out on data. Our statistics say there is a 94.09% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if for whatever reason the probability fails you, we've got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!\n\n### What is the age range?\n\nSome events have a suggested age range (noted in the title and description) and some are open to all ages. Whether you're a little outside the range or just curious about meeting people within it, you're welcome here.\n\nOur most popular events are open to all ages, drawing a vibrant and diverse crowd. Singles 30-45 tend to be the largest group. Followed by folks 45+ and then 20s. And while age might be a curiosity, what truly sets our events apart is the connection experience.\n\nBut here's the thing. It's more than just about the dates. And this is what makes Tantra Speed Date® unique. Singles everywhere rave about how the experience itself can be quite transformative, regardless of their matches. Why? Simply engaging consciously with other singles in a positive and structured way promotes more healthy relationships. And it just plain feels good to connect with real people. You likely have never experienced dating in such a fun and comfortable way. You'll gain confidence, pick up new skills, and will likely start to attract more quality people into your life. That's what our participants say over and over again!\n\n### Will there be enough people?\n\nDon't let low RSVPs in one spot fool you. Our events often sell out faster than you can say \"Namaste,\" and often with a waiting list. We're keen to promote across various platforms, and they don't all show the same love. Rest assured, we make sure there's always a crowd worth your while. So come on down; your next amazing connection could be just one RSVP away!\n\n### Do I have to be single to attend?\n\nAh, the modern relationship landscape—a tapestry of statuses! While you don't need to be 'single' in the traditional sense, you do need to be in a space where romantic connections are possible. If you're already committed and not open to new love, you may want to consider our couples events. But if you find your heart's door ajar, even just a smidge—or if you're teetering on the edge of 'ready to date'—this could be the perfect space to explore what's possible. Consider this your invitation to a playground of connection, perfect for testing the waters!\n\n### Is this a heterosexual event and is there a Queer/LGBTQ Tantra Speed Date?\n\nDiversity is the spice of life, and we're cooking up all kinds of flavors! This classic version of Tantra Speed Date® is primarily designed for men-seeking-women and women-seeking-men. In this setup you'll find yourself in one of two gendered circles—one for men and one for women. You'll rotate through up to 20 dates with members of the opposite gender. But don't fret, fabulous queer friends! We also host Queer Tantra Speed Date events in select cities. So if you're looking for a rainbow connection, keep an eye on our website to see when we're bringing that magic to a city near you!\n\n### What is your cancellation/refund policy?\n\nWe get it—life's a whirlwind! If you find yourself having to back out, no worries. Here's the lowdown: cancel 24 hours or more ahead and you'll get a refund or transfer, no fuss. If you're within that 24-hour window, or fashionably late and miss the opening ceremony, shoot us an email and we'll graciously \"speed date\" your ticket to the next event as a one-time courtesy. So keep your plans as flexible as a yoga pose, and communicate with us before the event kicks off. No refunds or transfers after the chimes ring and the magic starts!\n\n### Can I sign up with my friend?\n\nAbsolutely! We often have Bring-A-Friend ticket discounts! So thanks for sharing Tantra Speed Date® with your friends! However, do be sure to fill out their name and their email address on the attendee form. Otherwise we will not be able to check them in properly, and they will not receive all the wonderful matches they'll make at the event. If we had a nickel for how many times your friends email us wondering where their matches went... well, you get the picture. So please. Do your friends a solid and fill in their proper details.\n\n### More Questions?\n\nContact us at **help@tantrany.com** we'll be happy to tell you more about this event or others.",

    "description": "Hello everyone!\n\nOn 10/5, we’re hosting our next munch!\n\n—\n\n⚔️ Board Game Munch + Post-Event Drinks\n\n📅 Date: Saturday, October 5th, 2024\n\n⏰ Time: 06:00 PM - 11:00 PM\n\n📍 Location: 424 West 54th Street\n\n❄️ Icebreakers: 06:00 PM - 07:00 PM\n\n🍹 Drinks: 11:00 PM - 01:00 AM\n\n—\n\nAre you ready for another unforgettable experience that combines the thrill of board games, the opportunities for learning of our workshops, and the vibrant energy of a welcoming community? Look no further than Geekaholic, the ultimate destination for connoisseurs of kink, geeks, nerds, and newcomers to the vibrant NYC scene!\n\n—\n\n### THINGS TO KNOW:\n\n*   This is a munch, meaning no sex acts will be allowed at this event, and kink is only allowed in the classroom area upstairs during relevant workshops/highlights. However, discussion is allowed and encouraged anywhere during the event! This is a social gathering to meet fellow geeks and kinksters and enjoy a fun evening of games and conversation. Full rules can be found [here](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/rules).\n*   As always, this event is open to anyone and everyone to attend. We aim to create a safe space for members of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community and other marginalized groups. If anyone ever makes you feel unsafe at our events, please reach out to our staff.\n*   Our events are at a _dedicated_ venue at Prime Produce Co-op and are graciously hosted by PLAN Gaming ([https://www.plangaming.org/](https://www.plangaming.org/)), which is a non-profit incubator. All people present in the space will specifically be there for this event, so we can talk openly about kink and related topics.\n*   At Geekaholic, we believe in making our events accessible to everyone, so Geekaholic Munches operate on a \"Pay What You Can\" model. While we suggest a donation of $20, every contribution helps us sustain our partnership with Prime Produce and helps enrich our own future event programming.\n*   The space houses 90 games in its library and counting (see the full list on our [discord](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/discord)). But also, feel free to bring your own games! All board game skill levels, from newbie onward, are welcome!\n*   Our venue has a dedicated café on premises, but everyone is welcome to bring their own food/drinks as well. See the related section below for more info on our special menu offerings!\n*   We usually play board games for about five hours and then go for drinks at a nearby bar. Everyone (21+) is welcome for both!\n*   Most of attendees RSVP on fetlife. And we average at least 50 in person attendees. Feel free to RSVP there as well if you have an account, but an account is not required to attend our events.

Come into 424 West 54th Street and find our signup desk right at the entrance._\n\n🎭 **What is a Munch?**\n\n_A BDSM munch is a friendly, social gathering of people interested in BDSM or kink. It is a good event for newcomers, providing a safe space to learn, socialize and establish a rapport within the kink community. There is no nudity or sex, just fellow kinksters talking (and playing games!) - feel free to dress comfortably. We focus on creating a welcoming environment for everyone!_\n\n😨 **I’m feeling nervous! I’ve never been to something like this.**\n\n_Don't_ h_esitate to get in touch with us and let us know! We’ll take steps to introduce you to others and make you more comfortable. Don’t worry, all you’ll find is a bunch of people with similar interests playing games and having fun! If you have any questions about the event, send us a DM!_\n\n🍔 **Can we bring our own food, drinks, and/or beer?**\n\n_Yes! Even though we have a cafe on premises, you are welcome to bring anything to eat and drink._\n\n⚓ **What is “Cruising” and why is it prohibited at our events?**\n\n“_Cruising” involves either mass messaging attendees or attending events solely with the intent of soliciting casual sex or advertising other events and not seeking meaningful connections. In a BDSM munch, this goes against the respectful, consensual nature. Munches prioritize building connections, fostering community, and open conversations, not pursuing purely sexual encounters._\n\n📅 **How can I stay up to date with upcoming events?**\n\n_Stay connected and be the first to know about our monthly Tabletop RPG sessions, munches, road trips, parties, and more by joining our FetLife group_ [_here_](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/fetlife-group)\n\n📞 **Is there a way to stay in touch with everyone I meet?**\n\n_Absolutely! Connect with your friends and fellow attendees through our Geekaholic Discord server_ [_here_](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/discord)\n\n💨 **Is Marijuana/Vaping allowed?**\n\n_Feel free to step outside to smoke. Smoking indoors is prohibited, so please be considerate of those who may not partake._\n\n🔞 **Will I need to be over 21 to attend?**\n\n_No. You can attend as long as you're over 18. However, for the purchase/consumption of alcoholic beverages, you must present valid photo identification showing you are 21 or older to comply with NY state laws._\n\n📣 **How do I get involved or support the Geekaholic community?**\n\n_Thank you for asking!

Address provided after ticket purchase.\n\nDate and Time\n\nFri, Aug 30th at 7:00 PM to 11:45 PM. Doors will open at 7:00 PM and close at 7:30 PM. BE ON TIME as nobody will be admitted after the doors close to preserve the sanctity of the container we create. Everyone must be present for the opening circle. You may leave at any time.

All attendees are encouraged to be fully vaccinated. Please only attend if you are okay with being in a group of people indoors, regardless of their personal health choices or decisions to wear masks.\n\nWhat is a Temple Party?\n\nWe believe our bodies are sacred spaces and any time we dive into our deeper levels of consciousness and connect in ways that ignite our spirits, this is a sacred practice. Boundaries and consent are foremost, and we will provide guidelines for everyone to engage and still feel safe.\n\nA Temple Party is an opportunity to grow spiritually, play, explore, connect with people, and most of all to have fun. You might just want to observe (observing is a valid form of participation), or you might want to share light touch and cuddling or healing massage. You get to decide what you want to do, and you do not have to do anything you are uncomfortable with. You do not have to touch or interact with anyone unless you want to. All activities must be safe, sane and consensual, and within the boundaries we have set.\n\nWe adhere to common community guidelines and do not allow inappropriate behavior.\n\nWho Should Attend?\n\nAll persons 21 or older regardless of orientation, race, ability or religion. If you are open-minded and interested in sharing loving touch, we welcome you. If you are just curious but don’t want to play, you are welcome to come experience the atmosphere. Nobody will touch you without your verbal consent.\n\nWe expect everyone who attends to be able to abide by our guidelines and respect boundaries. Attendees should be able to communicate clearly with others and know their own limitations. We expect a level of emotional maturity and spiritual awareness that will allow you to function in a group setting.\n\nWhat to Wear\n\nDress in something comfortable! You will want to wear something you can easily move around in. Shoes will be left at the door.\n\nPlease do not use any scented products or perfumes before coming to the party to respect those with sensitivities to fragrance.\n\nWhat to Bring\n\nWe will have an area set aside for your belongings. Bring a water bottle (only closed-lid bottles containing water will be allowed in the play areas).\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nThis will be a relaxed, playful event. We will have an opening circle where we establish our container for the evening. We will review guidelines and discuss boundaries, followed by a brief ice-breaker activity. After that you will be free to explore on your own. Facilitators will be available to help guide your spiritual practices and ensure everyone stays within the boundaries we have set.\n\nExpect to have a fun evening and connect with some like-minded individuals. You get to decide how to participate. This is a safe space where participants are encouraged to explore themselves and others in ways that are spiritual, healthy, stimulating, nurturing, exciting, safe, consensual and fun!",

    "description": "Hosted by [Nix (the Sirenatrix](https://www.instagram.com/the.sirenatrix)) & Pagans Paradise Crew\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**The theme of this month's Sapphic Sirens party is Haunted Hoespital!!**\n\nPrepare yourself for a night of spine-tingling seduction at our _Haunted Hoespital_, where the only prescription is pleasure, and the cure might leave you breathless. 💉 Step into our sexy, spooky clinic filled with _just_ the right amount of creepy to get your heart racing and your temperature rising.\n\nExplore our playful medical stations, where naughty nurses and devilish doctors await to \"examine\" you. Get strapped into a _straightjacket_, or enjoy some consensual \"treatments\" designed to stimulate more than just your senses. This is a night for kink and play with a spooky twist, so come dressed in your sexiest scrubs, and let's get that blood pumping… in all the right ways.\n\nYou won't want to miss out on this one-of-a-kind evening of haunted fun, deliciously dark fantasies, and medical mischief. 👩‍⚕️🖤💀\n\n_NOTE: As usual - but especially given the hospital theme - anyone who would like to participate in anything that exceeds \"lite medical roleplay\" must reach out with scene descriptions at least 72 hours in advance. This is so that our Guardians can plan risk management and community comfort precautions with you._\n\n(Any questions, more info/details and community guidelines please see [PagansParadise.com](https://pagansparadise.com/))\n\n> Welcome to a mesmerizing evening at Sapphic Sirens, where we celebrate the splendor of sapphic connections. This event is a haven for women, trans, and non-binary/GNC individuals to enjoy camaraderie, community, pleasure, and playful moments. Please put \\*some effort\\* into your outfit - bonus points if it's on theme! We’re committed to creating a safe(r) and welcoming space to facilitate new relationships, exploration, and fulfillment of desires! Good vibes only — or else! ;)\n\n### Who Can Attend\n\nSAPPHICS (21+). If you do not fit the below definition, please do not come. This is meant to be an intentional space for sapphics to meet other sapphics. For everyone else, there are other Pagans Paradise events that you’ll love. Obviously, enforcing this policy is tricky, but we will trust attendees to respect our space and our intentions.\n\n> (Definition from [LGBTQIA+ Wiki](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Sapphic)) Sapphic, sometimes known as women loving women (WLW),or sapphist, refers to a woman or woman-aligned person of any sexual orientation who is attracted to women or woman aligned genders/gender identities. We mean to be specifically inclusive of non-binary people. It is an umbrella term for many identities, including those who are lesbian, pansexual, bisexual, or queer. It is used to promote solidarity among women and non-binary people of all identities who are attracted to those who are women and woman-aligned. It may also be used as an identity, and may be found particularly useful for individuals who know they are attracted to women but may be uncertain if they are attracted to other genders. It can also be used to describe a relationship between two women.\n\n**Ultimately, we reserve the right to remove anyone, sapphic or not, for any reason** - this is usually a last resort consequence of a breach of our Community Guidelines. Please respect this privileged space and treat it as your own home.\n\n### The Night will feature:\n\n*   Orientation: Nix, our host, will review guidelines about consent & mutual desire to ensure we’re all on the same page and will respect this privileged safe space. We’ll also explain the different rooms, play stations, and group activities throughout the night.\n*   Icebreakers: To facilitate new friendships and manifest fantasies, attendees will give a brief introduction including name, pronouns, and speak out loud any desires for the night. Note - this does not guarantee that your dreams will come true - and we discourage transactional Desperate D\\*ck/Predatory P\\*ssy energy! … but wishing out loud increases the chances of magic happening!\n*   Plenty of space to mingle around snacks, a low-stim room, and two play studios for two different vibes\n*   SAPPHIC Room: sensual & light, for massage, oils, etc.\n*   SIREN Room: kinky & dark, impact, rope, etc.\n*   Facilitators: We’ll have knowledgeable and approachable facilitators around to monitor safety and answer any questions.\n*   Limitations and Comfort: Everyone can engage according to their comfort level. There will be different rooms with different vibes, a hall to mingle in, and a low-stim chill room. Attendees can participate or just watch! Pagans Paradise is known for the welcoming, inclusive atmosphere that caters to newbies and scene veterans alike.\n\n### What to Bring:\n\n*   Dress to impress, bonus points if you dress on-theme\n*   BYOB / BYO-toys\n*   $$$ for vendors & performers (Thank you for supporting our community’s artists and entrepreneurs!)\n\n### **Ticket Prices**\n\n*   Early Bird $30\n*   Tier 1 $40\n*   Tier 2 $50\n*   At Door $60\n*   No refunds, if you cannot make it feel free to sell/donate ticket\n\n### **Schedule**\n\n*   7:30PM - 8:30PM: Mingling\n*   8:29PM: DOORS CLOSE (we mean it - please message in advance if this is an issue so we can expect you) \n*   8:30PM - Orientation, Icebreaker, and Performance(s)\n*   9:00PM - 1:00AM: Enjoy the various rooms of the space, each with different vibes. Feel free to connect with new folks or bond with a date.

While some time will be spent on rope handling techniques, this series will focus on both ends of the rope, to serve both folks giving and receiving it. Switching is welcome but not necessary!\n\nEach session will include a discussion, a short demo, and plenty of practice time.\n\nIn order to promote continuity of learning and community trust, we’d like to have a max of 10 pairs for the weekend  Registration price is for a pair (couple, partners, biddies, D/s, whatever kind of pair…). Drop-ins will NOT be available for any day, and registered pairs should remain the same throughout. \n\nWear any comfortable outfit you like to move in. We will have some jute rope to use for practice, but we encourage you to bring your own (so you can practice at home between sessions!). 2-3 pieces will suffice, any material is welcome.",

    "description": "Do you want a taste of Classical Tantra with elements from India?\n\nGet your tickets early as we often sell out!\n\nonly 30 stations available. :\n\nDo you want a taste of Classical Tantra with elements from India?\n\nMonique Darling and Peter Petersen invite you to the Art of Adoration Ceremony. A beautiful and sacred ancient ritual that has been practiced for thousands of years.\n\nIt is a beautiful ceremony of honoring and adoring the Divine that dwells within each of us, and brings us into a profound space of connection and universal Love.\n\nThis experience welcomes everyone, all faiths, and orientations.\n\nView the image gallery under the Discussion tab to get an idea what the experience will be like. (Pics and Videos from the last one)\n\nStep into a world of acceptance and sensation where all of you is welcome. Each person is invited into magical connections to expand your experience/capacity of giving and receiving. The ritual begins the moment you enter as you are celebrated, seen and adored for ALL you are.\n\nThis evening’s ceremony is dedicated to all genders. In fact, participants will not know whether they will be in the giving or receiving role until they arrive. We will use movement, sound and the five elements, all given to us with ample instruction, enriching each experience throughout the evening. You may find yourself turning inwards and becoming aware of abundant love and innate beauty that is part of your being.\n\nThis ceremony opens people's hearts in a way that allows them to see the inner beauty and the Divine within us all. The participants in the giving role will be instructed in performing an ancient ritual, which is simple in form yet very powerful in practice. As the participants in the receiving role accept the offerings and adoration, they in turn connect with unconditional love and reflect that adoration back to the givers with their presence. Taking part in these rituals is a very powerful way to reconnect and relate with all aspects of ourselves. It is through the practice of unconditional loving that we find that any emptiness or longing we feel within us can be filled with a simple act of giving.\n\nThis ancient ritual is thousands of years old. It was brought to life by those who implemented the practice of breathing life and awareness through the five elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Ether) in offering to the divine within every living being. We will offer fire, incense, roses, water, chocolate and more in adoration and worship of our divine essence.\n\nWe welcome you to reclaim your space and powerful place in the world as we unveil your deepest core. You will leave enchanted having fallen more deeply in love with YOU.\n\nWith open hearts and deep connection you will be \"rebirthed\" from a place of complete vulnerability and fullness as you choose to wake up to YOU!\n\nThis is a non-sxxual experience and welcomes everyone, singles will rotate, and couples may stay together if they want.\n\nLove Exchange: $89 a person\n\nGet your tickets here we often sell out\n\nLIMIT 30 STATIONS\n\nRSVP :\n\nWhat others have said about This Ceremony:\n\n\"Heart opening, will make you cry, have your energy flow through every pore, try it on\"\n\n\"Not knowing what to expect upon entering this illuminated room, I found myself being honored and revered in the most sacred way. I left feeling most loved. Thank you for the gift of myself\"\n\n\"A very supportive group to encourage claiming our full freedom and outrageous loveliness\"\n\n\"Don't ask, just go!! Serenity, grace, and fullness await\"\n\n\"I saw myself as a person capable of loving someone and being loved, realized my mom and dad ARE proud of me, I see in me the person I was always meant to be\"\n\n\"Sending out big hugs to Monique Darling for hosting such a beautiful Ceremony. You know, we all live in a world in which we are over worked and often under-appreciated. This ritual was an opportunity to have one's heart filled up with unconditional love. It was a transformative event, and I highly recommend it to everyone, whether you are woo-woo like me or not. Together we practiced giving and receiving non-sensual adoration. For example, we bathed each other's feet, fed each other chocolate, and showered words of affirmation on each other. We also opened up our hearts to speak vulnerable truths. At one point, we were invited to let go of something we no longer needed. I lit a small candle, and into it I whispered the words, \"I let go of the need to be right.\" And then with one breath, I blew out the flame and let it go!\" ~ Gayle Roberts, San Francisco\n\n\"Wow, the Adoration Ceremony was so much more powerful than I imagined. I arrived nervous, shy, and unsure of what might happen, and I emerged filled with gratitude, radiance, joy, and many new friends. Thank you Monique, for this incredible gift\"\n\n\"Monique's Adoration Ceremony was an experience to remember. Allowing Sacred Space for all to express themselves in whatever ways they needed to heal and come into their own sacred divinity.\"\n\n\"The Art of Adoration Ceremony created a nurturing environment that invited so much release. I feel like parts of my soul have been born again\"\n\nRSVP Here:\n\nWANT MORE? Join Monique, Peter and special guests for all of the yummy events while they’re in New York...

    "description": "Rope play has the capacity to empower and inspire both the giver and the receiver\n\nRSVP to save your spot:\n\nUnravel. Surrender. Receive.\n\n\"To tie is to embrace.\" - Arisue Go\n\nRope play is a form of sensual bondage. It is an art of connection and seduction, surrender and control, with both ancient roots and modern techniques. Rope play has the capacity to empower and inspire both the giver and the receiver. For the one bound in rope it can at times be paradoxically a very relaxing experience, not unlike swaddling a small baby. At other times being bound, tied, and released can flood the body with endorphins and adrenaline creating highly charged, ecstatic states. For the one doing the tying, rope becomes an extension of his or her hands. It is possible to create almost an infinite number of sensations with rope, from slow and sensual, to rough and biting. By cultivating energetic flow states, a deep sense of connection can develop between rope play partners.\n\nIntimate LEADERSHIP & empowered SURRENDER:\n\nan introductory rope and energy play class.\n\nIt is a small group workshop created for participants desiring a safe and welcoming introduction to ropes while exploring their emotional edges and learning how to confidently take and surrender control.\n\nIn the process, participants will learn about themselves through connection to their deepest and most vulnerable core. After all, it is only by releasing control that we can unleash our full potential, and only by stepping into our power can we invite another to give up theirs.\n\nThrough a combination of tantric practices, sacred sxxuality, and consent- and trauma-informed coaching, this shibari and energetic journey will guide you into an altered state of consciousness that allows for your deepest transformation in confidence, self-acceptance, and sensual expression.\n\nRina will teach a simple, but deceptively powerful style of rope play that require no knowledge of complicated knots. She’ll guide you through the basics of rope safety. She and Monique will offer simple techniques for using rope to cultivate energy and power exchange between consenting adults. Our focus is on using rope as a tool for helping partners develop emotional connection, intimacy, and trust.\n\nNo prior rope play experience is required. Basic energy play or power exchange experience is helpful, but not necessary. Couples and singles of all genders and orientations are welcomed. Uncoupled singles will be paired with other singles. Each participant will learn to tie and be tied. Rope and mats will be provided for those who don’t already have them.\n\nYou'll learn from two world-class practitioners one, former pro-domme, and the second a tantrika that has led over 3,000 workshops around the world. When you leave, hopefully you will have gained greater access to energy, surrender, play, and also will have gained the skills to practice shibari confidently, safely, and with a greater awareness of your and your partner's emotional needs in intimacy.\n\nLove Exchange $109 single $99 early bird and $169 for pairs\n\nTime 7-10:30 pm\n\nThis is a sensual event, but not sxxual, so bottoms will remain on for this weorkshop. We have several temple parties the weekend before where bottoms can come off ;)\n\nRSVP HERE:\n\nIf you would prefer to pay with Venmo or Paypal please text Monique here 619 601 8852, and she will send you the proper info to pay and register for the event.

Instead of leaving you to your guesses and assumptions, I will try to clarify what a shibari journey with me really is. My agenda is to offer a SACRED JOURNEY INTO VULNERABILITY. My journeys are a dance of technical skills and intuitive flow. Intuitive flow leads the way, while technical skills are ever-present for safe, practical applications.”\n\nRina is Austin's premier shibari instructor. A former professional dominatrix with twelve years' experience working with elite New York City clients, Rina has now redirected her conscious kink career toward providing vulnerability journeys through rope.\n\nTying together eleven years of tantric bodywork and meditation practices in Asia, Rina studies and performs shibari with the most celebrated masters in Japan and across the United States.\n\nA University of Maryland MBA graduate, certified death doula, and NLP and trauma-informed hypnotherapy practitioner, Rina combines her breadth of knowledge across somatic, spiritual, and sexual disciplines toward an utterly unique shibari modality that invites clients to access their deepest self-discovery and spiritual illumination.\n\nA freediver, BASE jumper, skydiver, student of ancient traditions, and self-described intrepid explorer of consciousness, Rina is also the creator of Underline | World (https://underline.world/), an online tantric immersion course, and appears frequently on podcasts for her work in vulnerability coaching and sacred sexuality.\n\nHer mission is to acquaint you with your own self: raw, unmasked, and intimately tied to your own truth.

Just like with regular events, if you're Friend level and above, you can bring up to two friends with you. Order in dinner, have a few drinks, run a friendly board game, or just read a book on the comfy couch. This is not a mixer -- just us opening our doors for our members.

    "description": "### Workshop: KINK TOUR \n\n> Embark on the **KINK TOUR**, your passport to exploring a world of desires, sensations, and play styles. This series is your guided journey through the basics of kink—think of it as a sightseeing trip through pleasure, where every workshop is a new destination. Whether you're just getting your first taste or you're an experienced traveler in the world of kink, you'll find something here to expand your horizons.\n\n> This tour is about sampling what’s out there, enough to give you a feel for different styles in a controlled, safe(r) environment. New to a particular kink? Get a guided introduction and try it on. Already familiar? Heighten your experience with deeper safety practices and improve your techniques. Wherever you are on your journey, this tour is designed to inspire, educate, and elevate your play. Enjoy the ride!\n\n#### Watching Them With Someone Else (Oct 9)\n\n*   **Variety of Headspaces**: Dive into the diverse range of emotional responses that can arise during this play, from feelings of humiliation and power, to compersion, pride, and even jealousy.\n*   **Relationship Foundations**: This type of play demands a strong, trusting relationship that allows for the possibility of mistakes or emotional shifts. Without ample room for failure and a shared desire to explore, things can go off the rails. Will you be prepared if they do?\n*   **Who Should You Ask?**: Should you bring in a professional or someone from your personal circle? And if it's a friend, which friend? Maybe...not _that_ friend! Learn how to make thoughtful choices that support the mutual desire of both parties.\n*   **Embracing the Complexity**: Discuss how to navigate the complex emotions that often arise, such as insecurity, excitement, or possessiveness, and how to communicate them effectively with your partner.\n\n((Come to all four workshops or drop in for just one! ))\n\n—-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all genders, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles, and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. \n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm. Please be on time and text ahead if you are delayed. \n*   You are welcome to wear a mask throughout the duration of the event.\n\n#### After the Workshop:\n\nStick around for our jam session, exclusively open to workshop participants. During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Nix & Rrrob will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Workshop 7:30-9:30 pm - Jam 9:45pm-11:45pm\n\n#### _Near Herald Square / Address given in confirmation email additional info / Elevator Access available at this location_\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n● **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n● **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\nSAVE WHEN YOU GO TO ALL FOUR: Workshops $140 or Workshop + Jams $260\n\n> KINK TOUR: Fall Series (Wednesdays @ Herald Square)\n\n> Breathplay (Sep 18th)\n\n> Primal Play (Sep 25th)\n\n> Objectification (Oct 2nd)\n\n> Watching Them With Someone Else (Oct 9th)",

    "description": "### Workshop: POWER PLAY | Pain & Physicality\n\n**Hosted by Nix (the Sirenatrix)**\n\n> This transformative edu-series on Power - designed for Dom(mes), subs, and switches - who wish to gain a deeper understanding of influence and surrender. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned veteran, this workshop will enhance your skills and scenes - and perhaps even your perspective.\n\n> This series of workshops will likely change the way you view power exchange, giving you a new appreciation for the intimacy involved in influence. Raising your voice in a domineering way isn’t the same as influencing your sub with a single whisper—true power tends to be subtle, grounded, intentional, and deeply connected. In **POWER PLAY**, you’ll learn how to get someone’s entire mind, body, and soul on board with your desires. You’ll learn to play with resistance, use your physicality, and make your presence felt down to the core. Every session will delve into a different facet of power dynamics. Embrace your role, refine your tools, and discover the depths of power exchange in a supportive educational environment.\n\n**Pain & Physicality**\n\n*   **Power in Pain**: Understand the connection between power and pain, and how to use physicality to deepen your scenes.\n*   **Impact Techniques**: Learn various impact tools and techniques to create the desired level of intensity while maintaining control.\n*   **Physical Power Exchange**: Utilize your bodies in more ways to create relational power.\n\n((Come to all four workshops or drop in for just one! ))\n\n—-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all genders, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles, and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. \n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm. Please be on time and text ahead if you are delayed. \n*   You are welcome to wear a mask throughout the duration of the event.\n\n#### JAM After the Workshop:\n\nStick around for our jam session, exclusively open to workshop participants. During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Nix & Rrrob will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Workshop 7:30-9:30 pm - Jam 9:45pm-11:45pm\n\n#### _Near Herald Square / Address given in confirmation email additional info / Elevator Access available at this location_\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n● **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n● **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\nSAVE WHEN YOU GO TO ALL FOUR: Workshops $140 or Workshop + Jams $260\n\n> POWER PLAY: Fall Series (Thursdays @ Herald Square)\n\n> Power Dynamics 101 (Oct 3rd)\n\n> Pain & Physicality (Oct 10th)\n\n> Influence & Control (Oct 17th)\n\n> Resistance & Brat Taming (Oct 24th)",

This special edition is open to the public.**\n\nHit Me Up afternoon social event featuring pop up market by [Charmskool](https://charmskoolshop.com/en-us), the UK’s favorite k\\*nk positive shopping destination. Get your hands on exclusive art & fashion from local & visiting international brands. Hello awesome Halloween outfits!\n\nFor our vetted members, this is a great chance to get to introduce yourself to the community and for us to get to know you so that we can invite you to our private events. If you're already a private member, our Hangouts are the perfect opportunity to make some new friends leading up to our upcoming private events.\n\nCome laugh, drink, and relax it off at the HMU loft with a crowd of new and old friends.\n\n**About the Event**\n\nJoin us as we welcome [Charmskool](https://charmskoolshop.com/en-us), the UK’s favourite Handmade K\\*nk Marketplace for their first **_ever_** stateside pop up market. Shop from 20+ local & international makers selling spicy fashion (lat3x, leather, lingerie), art & toys. We’ll also have some exciting activities throughout the day so look out for announcements! This event is part of a social at the expansive HMU loft, so expect drinks, tunes and chill vibes plus plenty of space to relax & meet new friends!\n\nWe are so excited to bring these incredible events together for one weekend of creative, inclusive spicy fun. Make sure you sign up for newsletters to stay in the know, **and** as a bonus, all ticket purchases come with a 15% off code to f3tish artisan website [Charmskoolshop.com](https://Charmskoolshop.com), as a welcome gift for their launch in North America!\n\n**I'm new, what are these like?** Our Hangout events are smaller and more intimate than our mixers, anywhere from 70 to 120 people usually show up. That means there are plenty of new folks to meet, and hopefully the right types for whatever you're into. Hangouts are only open to vetted members, which means a better awareness of our community standards than our public events.\n\nEverything is PG-13, and it's fairly easy to meet new folks—everyone who comes to these events is specifically looking to at least make new friends. So don't be shy, introduce yourself. And if you run into any problems or someone makes you uncomfortable, talk to a guardian with a red armband, and we'll take care of it.\n\n**Membership**: This event is open to the public. If you want to apply for our vetted membership to access our other events, you can go to [https://www.hitmeupnyc.com/join](https://www.hitmeupnyc.com/join) and fill out an application.\n\nThere will be no tickets sold at the door, all attendees must purchase them in advance.\n\n**Dress code**: There's no enforced dress code, but we recommend all black or something nice. A bit of kinky flair is always welcome. If you look like you're going to try to pitch us on a totally fair fantasy football trade or the landlord hustle lifestyle, you'll probably have less fun.\n\n**Volunteers**: We are looking for volunteers to work the door and guardian at this event. To volunteer please reach out to admin@hitmeupnyc.com.\n\n**Consent Policy**: This is an ASK FIRST event and the rules of respectful and consensual behavior WILL be enforced. You will be responsible for reading the policy and behaving appropriately. Guardians will be present throughout the night. Please click here to read our consent policy in full. **Aggressive cruising or aggressively asking for private member sponsorship or approval will not be tolerated.** Take time and get to know the community!\n\n**Accessibility:** The venue is wheelchair accessible with an elevator and no stairs to the front door. If you have questions about the space please email hello@hitmeupnyc.com.\n\n**Covid Safety:** Please stay home if you are feeling ill or if you have had recent close contact with someone who tested Covid positive (within the past 5 days). You could be incubating and still test negative. Any requests for refunds for any reason will be honored up to the day of the party. Just email hello@hitmeupnyc.com and we will give you a full refund, no questions asked.\n\n\\---\n\n**ABOUT HIT ME UP**\n\n**What is Hit Me Up?**\n\nHit Me Up is New York City’s curated community for poly and kink. We run meetups, parties, and teach kink at House of Yes, Caveat, Torture Garden, and other venues around the city.\n\nWe got our start running small events for our friends that quickly outgrew multiple venues. Now we have our own space and we are working to build the kink and poly community that NYC deserves—safer, friendlier, and weirder.\n\n**Why is Hit Me Up different?**\n\nOur core value at Hit Me Up is that poly and kink should be FUN. We balance accessibility and friendliness with a selective approach to membership to ensure that we get to hang out and play in the community we want to exist. Safety and respect are the only things we always take seriously.\n\n**How do you keep your events safe?**\n\n❣️ Our rules are actually enforced. If we say there’s a dress code, we will actually turn away anyone who doesn’t put in the effort to follow it. See our full consent policy for more details.\n\n❣️ We don’t oversell our events. There will always be space to breathe, to get away, and to get into what you’re into.\n\n❣️ Aggressive, cruising, and abusive behavior are dealt with quickly.\n\n❣️ Complaints and reports get action. We will never choose an extra ticket sale over risk to our members.\n\nWe are the guardians of the community, the space and the vibe, and we take that responsibility seriously. All of these things add up, and we think it shows in our membership and the incredible and weird things that can happen at our events.\n\n**How Do I Become A Member?**\n\nTo join Hit Me Up, go to [hitmeupnyc.com/join](https://hitmeupnyc.com/join) and fill out the application. It helps if you have an existing member to put down as vouching for you, but it’s not necessary. Membership is completely free, and is purely for vetting and safety purposes.\n\n**Can I get in touch with you?**\n\nFeel free to email us, [hello@hitmeupnyc.com](https://hello@hitmeupnyc.com). Hit Me Up is run by Alice and Hawthorne, two sexy weirdos who get off on making truly magical events.\n\nFor regular updates and educational content, follow us on instagram: [@hitmeupnycity](https://www.instagram.com/hitmeupnycity/?hl=en) and sign up for our [public newsletter](https://www.hitmeupnyc.com/newsletter).\n\nThat was a lot of reading, huh? Here's the thing—our ideal members are ones who read all the way to the end. Thanks for being with us. (Or just skipping to the end like an impatient middle schooler. For shame!)",

    "description": "Come learn some ways to make your bottoms wiggle and squirm with predicaments!\n\n**Hit Me Up: Tie Me Down - Intermediate Precarious Predicaments**\n\nYou've learned some cute ties, but now you want to learn to make someone squirm. The beauty of predicaments is that no matter which way they wiggle, your bottom is going to feel.... something. The struggle is amusing and relief is debatable.\n\nIn this class we will discuss what makes a predicament and how to create tension with rope. We will start with a floor tie and then a couple variations of partial suspensions to add to the wiggling. We will cover adding elements like hair rope, toe rope, gags and bamboo. There will be some smaller diameter jute rope that is great for hair rope available for use during class, and if you really like using it you can buy it after class.\n\nThis class is labeled at intermediate, which means you are solid with your single column and double column ties. But, this class is beginner friendly in the way that you do not need to know any specific harnesses to participate. We will also go over uplines and how to best utilize them for this type of scene.\n\nBring your full rope kit (this should include full lengths, half lengths of high quality rope such as jute, nylon or hemp) as well as your preferred rigging equipment (strap, ring and/or carabiners) and cutting shears. If you do not have rigging gear, you can purchase a climbing strap and carabiner at REI before class. We will mostly be using the hard point for stability, so you don’t need anything too fancy. You should also bring a fabric blind fold and smaller rope if you have it (4mm or twine is ideal!)\n\nTops: As this is labeled an intermediate class, you should be confident about your single column and double column ties. You should also have solid knowledge of basic frictions. If you need a refresher before class, review some of the videos here: [www.youtube.com/@TrixieLaPointe](http://www.youtube.com/@TrixieLaPointe)\n\nBottoms: You must feel comfortable being bound in challenging positions but also skilled at communicating your needs.\n\nAll bodies are welcome! There will be modifications offered for all body types and flexibility.\n\n**About Your Instructor**\n\nMistress Trixie LaPointe is a professional rope artist, dominatrix, performer and educator based in NYC. She has been exploring rope since 2018 and has been sharing her knowledge via classes and private lessons since 2021. She has been regularly seen working as a service top or performing at House of Love, House of X, Tempo by Hit Me Up, Femme Fatale, Chemistry and other events around NYC. She is proud proprietor of her own studio space La Maison Privée in Manhattan, where she holds various sessions as well as small classes and events.\n\n**FAQs**\n\n_What should I bring?_\n\nBring your full rope kit (this should include full lengths, half lengths of rope) as well as your prefered rigging equipment (strap, ring and or carabiners) and cutting shears. You should also bring a fabric blind fold/gag and smaller rope if you have it (4mm or twine is ideal!)\n\n_What should I wear?_\n\nWhatever you feel comfy in! Bodysuits, shorts or snug fitting workout clothes are generally perfect for classes. Please just keep your bottoms on!\n\n_Any pre-requisite skills needed?_\n\n**Tops**: As this is labeled an intermediate class, you should be confident about your single column and double column ties. You should also have solid knowledge of basic frictions. If you need a refresher before class, review some of the videos here: www.youtube.com/@TrixieLaPointe\n\n**Bottoms**: You must feel comfortable being bound in challenging positions but also skilled at communicating your needs.\n\n_Can I attend solo, or do I need to come with a partner?_\n\nThis class will be limited to 10 pairs - no solo tickets will be sold so you must come with a partner. Please note - if you are planning to switch, there might not be enough time for you to try every tie twice.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**STAY IN TOUCH!**\n\nInstagram [@hitmeupnycity](http://www.hitmeupnyc.com/hitmeupnycity)\n\nJoin our [public newsletter](https://www.hitmeupnyc.com/newsletter)\n\n✨Location: Lower Manhattan.

    "description": "### Workshop: POWER PLAY | Influence & Control\n\n**Hosted by Nix (the Sirenatrix)**\n\n> This transformative edu-series on Power - designed for Dom(mes), subs, and switches - who wish to gain a deeper understanding of influence and surrender. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned veteran, this workshop will enhance your skills and scenes - and perhaps even your perspective.\n\n> This series of workshops will likely change the way you view power exchange, giving you a new appreciation for the intimacy involved in influence. Raising your voice in a domineering way isn’t the same as influencing your sub with a single whisper—true power tends to be subtle, grounded, intentional, and deeply connected. In **POWER PLAY**, you’ll learn how to get someone’s entire mind, body, and soul on board with your desires. You’ll learn to play with resistance, use your physicality, and make your presence felt down to the core. Every session will delve into a different facet of power dynamics. Embrace your role, refine your tools, and discover the depths of power exchange in a supportive educational environment.\n\n**Influence & Control**\n\n*   **Beyond Physicality**: Discover ways to make someone melt - without even touching them!\n*   **Building Trust**: Learn how to create a safe container for power exchange that allows for vulnerability and growth.\n*   **The Dom/me Detector**: I’ll share my technique for “scanning” your sub for the buttons they’re begging you to push, even if they’re unaware of them! \n*   **Understanding Desires**: You can’t make someone melt in your hands if you don’t understand what they desire. \n\n((Come to all four workshops or drop in for just one! ))\n\n—-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all genders, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles, and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. \n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm. Please be on time and text ahead if you are delayed. \n*   You are welcome to wear a mask throughout the duration of the event.\n\n#### JAM After the Workshop:\n\nStick around for our jam session, exclusively open to workshop participants. During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Nix & Rrrob will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Workshop 7:30-9:30 pm - Jam 9:45pm-11:45pm\n\n#### _Near Herald Square / Address given in confirmation email additional info / Elevator Access available at this location_\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n● **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n● **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\nSAVE WHEN YOU GO TO ALL FOUR: Workshops $140 or Workshop + Jams $260\n\n> POWER PLAY: Fall Series (Thursdays @ Herald Square)\n\n> Power Dynamics 101 (Oct 3rd)\n\n> Pain & Physicality (Oct 10th)\n\n> Influence & Control (Oct 17th)\n\n> Resistance & Brat Taming (Oct 24th)",

    "description": "Join Petite Pretzel and KinkNamePending for an evening class on predicament bondage tailored specifically for the AMAB rope bottom. Our seasoned sadist, Pretzel, and power bottom, KNP, teach the art of prolonging and intensifying your bottom's suffering with meticulous precision. This is an open-ended exploration where students are encouraged to adapt the concepts to suit their unique dynamics and preferences. There's no one-size-fits-all approach; it's about embracing the process of learning and relishing the overall experience.\n\nIn this class, we delve into predicament bondage: crafting dilemmas that force the rope bottom to choose between different forms of pain, exhaustion, or humiliation. This is not a collaborative tie; it's a constantly evolving game of cat-and-mouse. The rope bottom seeks escape or respite, and the top skillfully removes those options, creating a captivating dance of control and surrender.\n\nAs your “evil genius” guide, Pretzel thrives on creating challenges that evolve into prolonged and increasingly difficult struggle. Her class \"A Rock and a Hard Place: Predicaments for Penis-Owners\" aims to strike a balance. It's not about making it so challenging that one gives up immediately or so easy that boredom sets in; it's about creating a dialogue through rope. The ropes become a medium for communication, a conversation where suggestions and responses inspire each other.\n\n#### Tickets sold as pairs.\n\n### [RSVP](https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=27853603&appointmentType=67520093) $140 per pair\n\n_$60 deposit, $80 cash at the start of class_\n\n#### **This class will cover:**\n\n*   Detailed anatomical information, to improve the efficacy of predicaments and ensure safety\n*   Psychological discussion of the perspectives of both top and bottom\n*   Intimate ties for genitals, specifically penis and testicles\n\n#### **Who can attend this class? Are there prerequisites?**\n\n*   Riggers should know how to proficiently tie the TK and proficient at tying mainlines/suspension lines.\n*   Riggers must know how to check for nerve impingement. You must inform your model of the risks of rope suspension.\n*   Riggers and models must have tied together prior to this class\n*   Rope bottoms should be able to be tied in an upper body harness and be very familiar with the differences between nerve and circulation impingement.\n*   Models must be able to recognise and communicate signs of nerve impingement to riggers effectively and timely. Models should be able to process pain and take enjoyment in intense sensations.\n\n#### **What should I bring and what do I wear?**\n\nPeople usually wear comfortable clothing like yoga or dance attire. We advise against loose fitting clothing and also jeans can sometimes feel a bit restrictive to move around in and difficult to tie on. Bring your own rope.\n\n#### **Who teaches this class?**\n\nPetite Pretzel is a rope switch from New York City. She has been teaching shibari (Japanese rope bondage) since 2019 at Anatomie Studio London, as well as at other UK venues (Oxford Rope Bight, Tangled Festival Derby, Edinburgh Rope Showcase), and abroad in the USA (Temple NYC), Greece (Athens Shibari), Germany (Eurix), and Sweden (Stockholm Pride). She has performed and taught live for Shambala Festival, Pinky Promise, Riposte Queer Rave, Fox & Badge. Her commercial rigging includes music video credits (Charli XCX, Christine + the Queens), art gallery installation (Elizabeth Xi Bauer gallery), fashion photography and full-length film. She lives in Bethnal Green with her cat, who loves ropes just as much as she does. You can find her on Twitter as @PetitePretzel and Instagram as @Petite\\_Pretzel. \n\nPen (KinkNamePending) is a UK-based rope switch from Croydon, South London. He loves the connections that shibari inspires and the wide range of experiences with vulnerability and trust it has brought him. Outside of rope, he is keenly interested in anatomy and physiology and has studied these topics extensively. He brings his perspective and understanding of the human body into rope and kink. He has performed in the UK as a rope-bottom at Tangled Festival, the Lust Supper, Pinky Promise and Fox Badge; and additionally abroad at Temple NYC in the USA, Eurix (European Rope Exchange) in Germany and for Stockholm Pride in Sweden. You can find him on Twitter and Instagram as @KinkNamePending.",

    "description": "We will be discussing the barriers regarding changing or ending partnerships, and how to move through them in new and imaginative ways.\n\nThe idea of ending or even changing a relationship dynamic with someone, is terrifying, partly because we fear losing someone we have grown intimate with and because of the messaging we've received about romantic partnerships from the dominant culture leading us to view breaking up, or even a relationship taking on a different form, as the relationship failing. This idea keeps people in relationship dynamics that are no longer serving them, barring them from their own authentic needs and desires.\n\nChampioning our own autonomy and our partner's(s) is crucial, in welcoming shifts to our relationships if something is not working for us.\n\nThis workshop dives into the emotional and tangible impact of major relationship shifts, and how to move them with compassion, grace and self assuredness.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n\\-Tools on how to initiate and welcome ALL major changes in relationships\n\n\\-Deepened understanding of the \"relationship escalator\" and how it influences why we stay in relationship structures that no longer serve us\n\n\\-Templates, ceremonies and rituals on how to have a conscious, proactive and loving decoupling\n\n**About Your Instructors**\n\nBear (he/him) & Fifi (all pronouns) are New York City-based Intimacy Coaches, Community Consultants, Event Producers, and Educators.

Lola Jean has a gift of gab, but she designed this class for even the timidest of speakers.\n\nWhether words are your only tool or just a little sprinkle to your scene, you don't need to be a tongue twisting wordsmith to master mental domination. Verbal domination pulls from many of the same tactics as physical, only your words are the tools. Learn how to trap someone in their own mind and use their thoughts against them. When we play with mind the only bounds are that of our imagination. We can play in fantasy as much as we play in reality.\n\nWe will run the gamut from sweet to sadistic. In this class you will learn how to incorporate more verbal elements pre, during, and post-scene. Learn how to use someones words to inspire and further the scene, how to create a world that isn't there and how to find, expose and RELEASE an insecurity.\n\nIn addition to these overall concepts, you will walk away with several tactics and tools build to confuse, gain intel, and direct particular attention to the words you are saying. Lola Jean pulls well beyond typical domination approaches by weaving in learnings from the hypnosis, thespian, and journalism communities.\n\n**FAQ: what should I bring?**\n\npen and paper for notetaking if you feel so inclined\n\n**FAQ: what should I wear?**\n\nwhatever your heart desires\n\n**FAQ: any skill pre-requisites? (i.e., is this for beginners, advanced, everyone?)**\n\nfor anyone - beginner or pro\n\n**FAQ: can I attend solo, or do I need to come with a partner?**\n\nsolo or partnered!\n\n**About Your Instructor**\n\nLola Jean is a Sex Educator, Fetish Wrestler, headmistress of 7 Days of Domination, and World Record Holder for Volume Squirting (solo.) providing the No Frills Sex Education we both need and deserve. Lola brings a refreshing understanding to sex, sexuality, and kink to push individuals past what they think they are capable of.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**STAY IN TOUCH!**\n\nInstagram [@hitmeupnycity](http://www.hitmeupnyc.com/hitmeupnycity)\n\nJoin our [public newsletter](https://www.hitmeupnyc.com/newsletter)\n\n✨Volunteers: Limited volunteer spots available.

    "description": "### Workshop: POWER PLAY | Resistance & Brats\n\n**Hosted by Nix (the Sirenatrix)**\n\n> This transformative edu-series on Power - designed for Dom(mes), subs, and switches - who wish to gain a deeper understanding of influence and surrender. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned veteran, this workshop will enhance your skills and scenes - and perhaps even your perspective.\n\n> This series of workshops will likely change the way you view power exchange, giving you a new appreciation for the intimacy involved in influence. Raising your voice in a domineering way isn’t the same as influencing your sub with a single whisper—true power tends to be subtle, grounded, intentional, and deeply connected. In **POWER PLAY**, you’ll learn how to get someone’s entire mind, body, and soul on board with your desires. You’ll learn to play with resistance, use your physicality, and make your presence felt down to the core. Every session will delve into a different facet of power dynamics. Embrace your role, refine your tools, and discover the depths of power exchange in a supportive educational environment.\n\nResistance & Brat Taming\n------------------------\n\n*   **The Dance of Resistance**: Understand the dynamics of resistance and how to use it to heighten the tension and excitement in your scenes.\n*   **Taming the Brat**: Learn the art of brat taming, how to enjoy playful resistance, and transform it into a powerful exchange of energy.\n*   **Power Struggles**: When you feel a “Clash” between you and your counterpart, learn how to move the energy.\n\n((Come to all four workshops or drop in for just one! ))\n\n—-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all genders, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles, and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. \n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm. Please be on time and text ahead if you are delayed. \n*   You are welcome to wear a mask throughout the duration of the event.\n\n#### JAM After the Workshop:\n\nStick around for our jam session, exclusively open to workshop participants. During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Nix & Rrrob will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Workshop 7:30-9:30 pm - Jam 9:45pm-11:45pm\n\n#### _Near Herald Square / Address given in confirmation email additional info / Elevator Access available at this location_\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n● **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n● **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\nSAVE WHEN YOU GO TO ALL FOUR: Workshops $140 or Workshop + Jams $260\n\n> POWER PLAY: Fall Series (Thursdays @ Herald Square)\n\n> Power Dynamics 101 (Oct 3rd)\n\n> Pain & Physicality (Oct 10th)\n\n> Influence & Control (Oct 17th)\n\n> Resistance & Brat Taming (Oct 24th)",

    "description": "This class will teach ties that incorporate a thin bamboo stick by tying it against the body. The ties are designed to introduce an additional element of restriction, when tying on the floor, utilizing the rigidness of the bamboo stick as opposed to the very pliable quality of rope.\n\nWe start the class by techniques to attach rope, body and bamboo together well, as this can be a challenge as bamboo is a slippery surface to tie on. Then specific ties, with themes like posture, exposure and torment, are taught. Detailing matters of placement of bamboo along the body, with body mechanics in mind, to achieve the desired effect.\n\nThis is a mixed level class suitable for students confident in fundamental tying techniques; You need to be able to tie single column tie well, without teacher support, and have prior experience in attending Shibari classes or workshops. It is not recommended as an introduction to shibari. Switching roles between ties is welcome if both partners are capable, but not mandatory.\n\n#### Tickets sold as pairs. $120 per tying pair\n\n_$40 deposit, $80 cash at the start of class_\n\nRSVP\n----\n\n#### If the event is sold out, you can sign up for a [WAITLIST HERE](https://forms.gle/r4beaT43sK8jxua8A)\n\n_CANCELLATION POLICY: you can reschedule once or ask for a refund up to 48 hours before the event. If you would like a refund, please email us at temple.nyc.bushwick@gmail.com , and we will take care of it with you. A processing fee of 5% will be subtracted from all refunds. No refunds will be issued with less than 48 hours notice of cancellation._\n\n_Payment processing note: You will see a charge to “Porter Cycles” when paying for all our events!_\n\n#### **Bring**: \n\n*   4 ropes and 2 short pieces of about 4 meters each.\n*   It is highly recommended that the ropes are loosely layered jute, sold for the purpose of Shibari specifically, as the class content is designed for this type of rope.\n*   Bamboo sticks will be provided by Temple.\n\n#### **Tam’s Bio:**\n\nTamandua is a Swedish rigger based in Berlin, Germany. He has been working with rope professionally, primarily through teaching and offering intimate sessions to clients, since 2016.\n\nAlthough a rope top most of the time, he has broad experience as a rope bottom as well, and highly values ability to relate to both perspectives. He is a queer person, who appreciates tying with people of various gender. \n\n‘I consider kinbaku to be a complex erotic art, which is empathetically sadomasochistic at it’s core. Often tying in a way that can be challenging both for the one tying and the one in the ropes, my Shibari usually demands a lot of technical clarity when in the role of a teacher. At the same time, the student’s individuality is a priority when it comes to learning methods and intention. I view Kinbaku as a practice of continuous exploration – where new doors open as you go deeper and further with a partner, over the course of a session, or over the course of a long partnership. Sometimes though, the magic that defines Kinbaku can be just that one alluring image that sticks with you, a moment suspended in time. For me, the essence of Kinbaku lies in the meeting between the aesthetic expression and the emotional and sensual intention of the practice. And the more ones tying develop, the more seamlessly the parts can intermingle.’\n\nTamanduakinbaku.com",

The majority of our production team and cast represent BIPOC people from all over the world. We center the black experience in our performance art and immersive experiences. We bring focus to BIPOC. And we welcome and celebrate everyone of all identities, races, nationalities, and ethnicities!\n\n**SEX POSITIVE & LOVE STYLES**\n\nWe welcome all love styles to use us as the best date night destination. Whether you're monogamous, nonmonogamous, or polyamorous, our community includes those of all love styles and is sex-positive. Whether it's the first date, the 10th, or you're celebrating a milestone anniversary, we'd love to have you join us.\n\n**QUEER & STRAIGHT PEOPLE**\n\nOur entire company and those we work with include many from all aspects and identities of the Queer community (LGBTQIA2S+) All are welcomed into our community no matter who you are or who you're into.\n\n**KINK & BDSM**\n\nOur leadership team and production team are all BDSM and Kink practitioners, lifestylers, and/or professionals. While select feature performers may be Vanilla, our experiences, and shows are immersed in all kinds of subversive kinks if you want to see them. However, vanilla is a flavor, and those who identify as such can have an equally enjoyable experience. (Select BDSM events and play parties, due to their nature, are vetted and/or invite-only.)\n\n**SHADOWS OF INCLUSIVITY**\n\nThere are many areas of inclusivity any person or organization can choose to focus on. We are also keenly aware that due to trending or more socially acceptable forms of inclusivity and diversity, marginalized and oppressed people sometimes fall further into the shadows of inclusivity. Noting this, we also tend to cast and produce on the fringes and within the shadows often overlooked.\n\n**THE LIST** - Subscribe to the Siren Pack newsletter for first access to tickets and special enchantments: [http://bit.ly/SirenPackMailingList](http://bit.ly/SirenPackMailingList)\n\n**ABOUT SIREN PACK:** An immersive & subversive burlesque variety company producing provocative experiences.
