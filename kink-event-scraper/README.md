# Overview

This is a starter Node.js app configured for TypeScript. The app is generated
using [create-functions]:

```
npx create-functions [path]
```

> **Note**
>
> - If `path` isn't specified, it defaults to the current working directory (`.`).
> - The directory under `path` must be empty.

See [article on dev.to] for more details.

Configuration boilerplate includes:

-   [TypeScript]
-   [Express]
-   [Jest]
-   Linting and formatting
    -   [EditorConfig]
    -   [ESLint]
    -   [Prettier]

The linting and formatting tools have been configured to  work together:

* `.editorconfig` has format settings that feed into Prettier
* `.eslintrc.json` uses Prettier for formatting

It is also configured with a `pre-commit` hook using [Husky] and [lint-staged]
that will automatically reformat your source files when you commit.

## Development

The generated app includes a number of package scripts, most importantly:

- `build`
- `test` | `test:watch`
- `deploy`

For normal development, just run `test:watch`. This will restart the Express app
on file changes under the `src` or `test` directories, and also re-run tests.

There is also a `prepare` script that configures a git `commit` hook (using
[Husky]) for linting. You need to run this if you cloned this repo instead of
generating the app using [create-functions].

## Notes

To use the latest published version of [@subfuzion/create-functions], enter:

```
npx create-functions@latest [path]
```

If you want to use the latest version [create-functions] version from the
GitHub repo, enter:

```
npx github:subfuzion/create-functions [path]
```
