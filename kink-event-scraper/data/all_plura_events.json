Erebus)\n\nDevelop natural charisma & charm to initiate conversation with authenticity!\n\n**_Join us as we uncover the keys to having successful first time interactions at any bar/party/social event of your choosing!_**\n\n﻿**_(Get 20% off next_** [**_Kinky Speed Dating_**](https://kinkyspeeddatingAug30.eventbrite.com) **_if you take this event, Promo code will be in your email confirmation)_**\n\n_The focus on this day will be_ **_FLIRT!_** _Learn how to better flirt and read when others are flirting with you and the interest is mutual!_\n\n**What this is:**\n\nMerriam-Webster defines “Rizz” as romantic appeal or charm. Whether your goal in building a connection with someone is romantic or not, having the ability to present yourself in a charming and confident way is a major component to your success.\n\n**In this workshop, we will provide you with the skills/information to achieve this through:**\n\n*   Live feedback and support from a dating coach and pro dom.\n*   Mindfulness and meditation techniques to ground yourself in your body and the current moment.\n*   A detailed layout on what constitutes a successful interaction.\n*   Live demonstration on how to approach someone of interest.\n*   An opportunity to practice your “rizz” in a judgment free, safe space.\n\n**What this is not:**\n\nThis is not a class on “pick-up artistry”. This workshop is intended to explore and utilize effective social skills in order to uncover mutual desire and build a genuine connection.\n\nThis is not a lecture. While many wonderful classes share very important information on what to say in social situations and how to say them, we will go beyond information sharing by giving you the tools you need to feel confident, worthy, and charismatic enough to interact with ANY person you are interested in meeting.\n\n**Who is this for?**\n\nThe workshop is all-inclusive and open to all genders and orientations. It is intended for anyone looking to start a healthy interaction with a person of interest on any social platform, whether it be online, in a bar, at a party, social event etc.\n\n**You will want to attend this workshop if you have ever asked yourself:**\n\n*   How do I start a conversation with a new person?\n*   How can I be more confident in my approach?\n*   What can I do to be more engaging?\n*   Has my personal energy (Potential Desperate D\\*ck/Predatory P\\*ssy energy) been off putting to others and not well received?\n\n**Is this a Solo or Partnered act/experience?**\n\nThere will be moments throughout the workshop where we will invite you to pair up with someone to practice some of the material. All activities and exercise are completely voluntary so if you wish to not pair up that is more than fine.\n\n**The Workshop Experience:** This is an in-person workshop in a beautiful and private studio space in Koreatown (near Herald Square). The workshop will include 2.5 hours of discussion & instruction where you will be able to receive and explore new techniques and positions. If you desire, you may receive hands-on practice and demonstration.\n\nNOTE: _We will focus heavily on creating a container that pushes safety and personal agency. We will not tolerate anyone who comes to the space to make others feel uncomfortable or create harm._\n\n**Workshop Tickets: Early Bird $30, Classic $40**\n\nThis event is perfect and open for all experience levels.18+ for workshops. Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. Doors open at 7pm and closes at 7:15 pm please be on time.\n\nAny questions or concerns email [PagansParadiseNYC@gmail.com](mailto:PagansParadiseNYC@gmail.com)\n\nJCflowerscoaching.com\n\nPagansParadise.com\n\nDaddyRetreat.com",

    "description": "#### Workshop: CARE-FULL: Aftercare & Debriefs\n\nKink is inherently risky and there’s no way around it. It doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a seasoned kink veteran - the unexpected _will_ occur. In those moments, the integrity of our systems is put to the test. \n\nSafety is not the absence of incidents or accidents; it’s the presence of barriers and defenses against them. So… how safe are you as a kink partner? What measures do you take to keep your scenes safe? The CARE-FULL series of workshops will provide immense value to your play. \n\nCome to all four workshops or drop in for just one!\n\n#### Week Two: Aftercare & Debriefs\n\n*   **Planning Aftercare:** Strategies for designing effective aftercare tailored to individual needs.\n*   **Providing Effective Aftercare:** Addressing common aftercare needs, including first aid and emotional aftermath.\n*   **Debriefing Framework:** Techniques for conducting thorough and supportive debriefs after play.\n*   **Mitigating & Managing Drop:** Methods for preventing and managing emotional drop post-scene.\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all gender identifications, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. \n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm. Please be on time and text ahead if you are delayed. \n*   You are welcome to wear a mask throughout the duration of the event.\n\n#### After the Workshop:\n\nStick around for our jam session, exclusively open to workshop participants. During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Nix will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Workshop 7:30-9:30 pm - Jam 9:45pm-11:45pm\n\n#### _Near Herald Square / Address given in confirmation email additional info / Elevator Access available at this location_\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n● **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n● **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\nCARE-FULL: Late Summer Series (Thursdays)\n\n1.

Reid stepped down from teaching and initiated a restorative justice-based accountability process to address his misconduct and make amends if and where possible. The formal, year-long process along with Reid’s apology and resources were shared publicly and can be found at TinyURL.com/reidaccountability.\n\nGoing forward, Reid’s projects and appearances will include pointing people towards resources and experts on restorative and transformative justice-based accountability processes.\n\nReid’s workshops and college lectures have been attended by over 60,000 people from all over the globe. He has appeared in media such as Oprah's Our America With Lisa Ling on OWN, NETFLIX, Montel, Dr. Phil's The Doctors on CBS, Bravo's Miss Advised, Fox News, in Newsweek, Seventeen, GQ, The Washington Post, and in thirteen countries and at least seven languages.\n\nReid is also founder of Sxx Geek Summer Camp, Sxx Geek Conservatory, and Sxx Geek School for Gifted Sxx Geeks, which help sxx educators learn valuable business skills that allow them to reach more people with greater ease, transform more lives, and make a better living as sxxperts.\n\nFollow @ReidAboutSex on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube.\n\nMonique Darling, Author of 'Beyond Cuddle Party' and workshop facilitator extraordinaire has led over 3000 workshops in the past 16 years. She is the founder of Everyday Tantra an organization dedicated to empowering people who are questioning the assumptions of how their life should be and to offering tools for self expression that create trust, inner knowing and wisdom to enjoy the life they have.\n\nMonique has taught at colleges across the US including Yale. She has been featured on TLC and The Dr’s as well as various radio shows, podcasts and magazines across the globe. She specializes in helping others reclaim their power and natural sensuality by transmuting fear and repression into courage, self-love and freedom. Her primary purpose is helping folks bring out their vulnerability, energetic embodiment and fearless relating.\n\nLearn more about Monique by going to www.Everydaytantra.com\n\nPeter Petersen has been teaching qigong for 20 years and has been a certified massage therapist for the last 18 years. Peter has been teaching in health clubs, hospitals, retirement villas, and several different wellness/spa resorts in Mexico and the United States, such as Rancho La Puerta, Mayacamas Ranch, and Present Moment Retreat.\n\nPeter is also a personal wellness coach. This Qigong practice helps people ground themselves into their “now” to increase their present moment awareness of their behaviors, and find simple solutions to problematic habits such as: eating, moving, negative thinking, and sleeping. The result of this tool box of healthy information is that clients become their own health advocate and regain a sense of stability, peace, and well-being into their everyday lives.",

Maybe it’s both. You long to experience the freedom of ecstatic pleasure, to completely surrender to Eros, but there is resistance in your body. A thought creeps in, a voice, a memory perhaps, that speaks of unworthiness. An insecurity that nags at the back of your mind. You push away the discomfort, avoiding it like a person you don’t want to talk to… “This is a party! You are here to have fun” you tell yourself as you nervously begin to mingle.\n\nThe temple priests and priestesses have been in ceremony preparing this holy temple. Praying for your arrival. Sanctifying the space. Curating the ceremony. Cultivating a powerful vortex of eros energy with healing intention.\n\nAll of you is welcome here. Your shame, your guilt, your grief and sorrow. Bring those energies to the altar, release and sacrifice them to Eros as an offering of devotion.\n\nFeel the vibrations of the music of erotic energetic pleasure cleanse your body and soul. Move your body to the rhythm moving those energies that no longer serve you out to make space for eros.\n\nEros sanctifies us as we transmute our woundedness into wild erotic authenticity. This will be uncomfortable but the only way out is through, clearing blocks to surrender to ecstatic pleasure. You are worthy. Pleasure is holy.

    "description": "#### Workshop: CARE-FULL: **Week Three: Managing Unknowns** \n\nKink is inherently risky and there’s no way around it. It doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a seasoned kink veteran - the unexpected _will_ occur. In those moments, the integrity of our systems is put to the test. \n\nSafety is not the absence of incidents or accidents; it’s the presence of barriers and defenses against them. So… how safe are you as a kink partner? What measures do you take to keep your scenes safe? The CARE-FULL series of workshops will provide immense value to your play. \n\nCome to all four workshops or drop in for just one!\n\n#### **Week Three: Managing Unknowns**\n\n*   **Risk vs Uncertainty:** Understanding the difference and its implications in kink scenes.\n*   **Conducting Risk Assessments:** How to evaluate and manage potential risks in your play.\n*   **Contingency Planning:** Preparing backup plans for various scenarios.\n*   **Adapting to the Unexpected:** Techniques for staying flexible and responsive during scenes.\n*   **Blindspots and Common Mistakes:** Identifying and avoiding common pitfalls in risk management.\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all gender identifications, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. \n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm.

During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Nix will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Workshop 7:30-9:30 pm - Jam 9:45pm-11:45pm\n\n#### _Near Herald Square / Address given in confirmation email additional info / Elevator Access available at this location_\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n● **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n● **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\nCARE-FULL: Late Summer Series (Thursdays)\n\n1.

Having that as the base for our first meetings laid the foundation for honesty and trust._\"\n\n— Jihan & Joseph\n\n![](https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F412345379%2F287337217873%2F1%2Foriginal.20221220-155143?h=2000&w=720&auto=format%2Ccompress&q=75&sharp=10&s=35382611e76b7802f44680fb498cc5ea)\n\n### 👇TSD originator Guy Shahar demonstrates some of the connection games!👇\n\n### 👆TSD originator Guy Shahar demonstrates some of the connection games!👆\n\n![](https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F587614489%2F1493533057%2F1%2Foriginal.20230831-192748?h=2000&w=720&auto=format%2Ccompress&q=75&sharp=10&s=44e4a31ea191ed8bfa49fec90ae67395)\n\nMore Than Just A Speed Dating Event\n-----------------------------------\n\nAt Tantra Speed Date®, our mission goes beyond just helping you find your next match.\n\nWe're committed to helping you bring more connection into your love life wherever you go!\n\nThat's why our guided exercises have a \"secret\" purpose; they **enhance your relationship skills in subtle, yet powerful ways...**\n\nSo you'll walk away not only with matches but also with a new level of confidence in yourself as both a person and a partner!\n\nPlus, you'll learn how to bring more presence into **_all_** your interactions going forward...\n\nWhich will allow you to start engaging with your future dates in a way that's **fun, authentic, and even healing.**\n\nSo if you were wondering why singles have dubbed this event as \"Yoga for your Love Life\"...\n\nWell, now you know!\n\n![](https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F594664049%2F1493533057%2F1%2Foriginal.20230911-041813?h=2000&w=720&auto=format%2Ccompress&q=75&sharp=10&s=e4b8080d4abea40d1ba343c423ea255d)\n\nFAQ\n---\n\nDon't see your question answered below? Check out the [FAQ on our website](https://tantrany.com/speed-dating/?aff=4ebfaq) (bottom of page)!\n\n### What is Tantra, and why \"Tantra\" Speed Date?\n\nForget those wild myths and blockbuster misunderstandings; Tantra is more about connection, fun, and being present than anything risqué. Imagine it as the art of \"relationship yoga,\" blending age-old practices with a twist of joy and mindfulness. Through exercises like breathing, meditating, and maybe even a little dancing, you'll find yourself more in tune with those around you. It's like a social superpower for making genuine connections, and trust us, it's a blast! After all, we find this level of presence is exactly what's missing from most dating encounters today. Why just talk when you can laugh, connect, and explore together?\n\n### What does this style of dating look like?\n\nPicture this: You'll form two fun-filled circles of fellow daters. The men make up the outer ring, and the women form the inner ring; so that you're paired off with a friendly face across from you. Together, you'll dive into engaging and heartfelt mini-dates (we call them 'dating stations') that last just long enough to spark a connection. After each experience, you'll bring your hands into a cheerful 'Namaste', share a quick thank you, and then — whoosh! — off to the next exciting meeting. Keep circling around, and by the end, you'll have met everyone.\n\n### What kinds of exercises will I do?\n\nNo clichéd icebreakers here! Our exercises are all about authentic human connection, not cheesy romance. We're talking engaging dialogue, light partner yoga, movement/dance, heartwarming eye-gazing, and even some gentle hand-holding. It's a delightful mix that goes beyond the mundane 'what's your job' chatter.\n\nThe coolest part? Every exercise is wrapped around a positive relating skill. So, not only will you have a blast, you'll be building real relationship skills too! And remember consent, you're the boss of how you participate. It's all about fun and connection in a way that feels good for you.\n\n### What if one of the exercises is not my cup of tea?\n\nThanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify, or completely opt out. Everyone is encouraged to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators do a fabulous job demonstrating what that looks like, so it feels good for everyone.\n\n### So how does this all add up to dating?\n\nGreat question! Think of it as a refreshing twist on the traditional dating scene. You'll get to interact, laugh, and connect with others, and then decide who you'd like to get to know better. We put a fun spin on things by letting the ladies take the lead in choosing; they'll place one of their beads in each man's pouch that they want to connect with. They'll get a feel for the guys' personalities and presence, while the men are guided on how to be grounded and open-hearted. Afterwards, either party can contact the other. It's all about letting connections unfold naturally.\n\n### What is the schedule?\n\n*   **Doors Open**: Right at the start time, we'll check you in, hand over your dating materials, and give you a playing card for a super fun Ice Breaker game. You've got until the stations begin to mix and mingle!\n*   **20 minutes in**: Time to let in folks from the waiting list, making sure everything's balanced and ready to roll.\n*   **30 minutes in**: Ice Breaker game wraps up, and the doors close. Now the real fun begins as we kick off the event. Be sure to check in before this time, or you'll miss out on all the excitement! (Running late or need to cancel? Check our policy below.)\n*   **End of the Night**: You'll feel the warm glow of connection and may not want it to end. While we'll gently nudge you toward the door, it's common for guests to join together for dinner, continuing the connections and conversations. Who knows? Your night might just be getting started!\n\n### What should I wear?\n\nThink comfort with a touch of your best self! You'll be sitting and also moving, so choose an outfit that lets you feel relaxed but still sharp. Just remember, it's a date, so grooming matters. And go easy on strong scents; some people are sensitive.\n\n### Is there food or drink at the event?\n\nWe usually don't serve food or drinks (unless it's a special event), so feel free to bring a water bottle. Snacks might be good for before or after, but check with the venue, as some don't allow food. As tempting as a quick bite during the event might be, you'll want all your attention on your dates. And remember, alcohol is a no-go, so please arrive with a clear and ready mind.\n\n### How many dates will I have?\n\nGet ready for a lively evening with up to 20 opportunities to connect! Our events typically max out at around 40 singles. Assuming a balanced mix, you'll have the chance to spark a connection with up to 20 different people. And, we're all about quality not quantity. You'll find each moment meaningful as you dive into engaging exchanges with others who, just like you, are looking to explore connection and authenticity.\n\n### What is the gender balance at the event?\n\nWe don't believe in leaving anyone out of the fun, so we do our best to aim for an equal gender balance. Of course, it isn't always 100% under our control--even our matchmaking powers have their limits. But so far, just about every event has been sold out. And since we have an equal number of tickets per gender, they've all had a solid mix of singles ready to mingle! (We also occasionally use door sales magic to balance the gender too.)\n\n### What if I don't match with anyone?\n\nAs many of our attendees say, \"I don't even care if I match with anyone, this was amazing!\" That said, we geek out on data. Our statistics say there is a 94.09% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if for whatever reason the probability fails you, we've got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!\n\n### What is the age range?\n\nSome events have a suggested age range (noted in the title and description) and some are open to all ages. Whether you're a little outside the range or just curious about meeting people within it, you're welcome here.\n\nOur most popular events are open to all ages, drawing a vibrant and diverse crowd. Singles 30-45 tend to be the largest group. Followed by folks 45+ and then 20s. And while age might be a curiosity, what truly sets our events apart is the connection experience.\n\nBut here's the thing. It's more than just about the dates. And this is what makes Tantra Speed Date® unique. Singles everywhere rave about how the experience itself can be quite transformative, regardless of their matches. Why? Simply engaging consciously with other singles in a positive and structured way promotes more healthy relationships. And it just plain feels good to connect with real people. You likely have never experienced dating in such a fun and comfortable way. You'll gain confidence, pick up new skills, and will likely start to attract more quality people into your life. That's what our participants say over and over again!\n\n### Will there be enough people?\n\nDon't let low RSVPs in one spot fool you. Our events often sell out faster than you can say \"Namaste,\" and often with a waiting list. We're keen to promote across various platforms, and they don't all show the same love. Rest assured, we make sure there's always a crowd worth your while. So come on down; your next amazing connection could be just one RSVP away!\n\n### Do I have to be single to attend?\n\nAh, the modern relationship landscape—a tapestry of statuses! While you don't need to be 'single' in the traditional sense, you do need to be in a space where romantic connections are possible. If you're already committed and not open to new love, you may want to consider our couples events. But if you find your heart's door ajar, even just a smidge—or if you're teetering on the edge of 'ready to date'—this could be the perfect space to explore what's possible. Consider this your invitation to a playground of connection, perfect for testing the waters!\n\n### Is this a heterosexual event and is there a Queer/LGBTQ Tantra Speed Date?\n\nDiversity is the spice of life, and we're cooking up all kinds of flavors! This classic version of Tantra Speed Date® is primarily designed for men-seeking-women and women-seeking-men. In this setup you'll find yourself in one of two gendered circles—one for men and one for women. You'll rotate through up to 20 dates with members of the opposite gender. But don't fret, fabulous queer friends! We also host Queer Tantra Speed Date events in select cities. So if you're looking for a rainbow connection, keep an eye on our website to see when we're bringing that magic to a city near you!\n\n### What is your cancellation/refund policy?\n\nWe get it—life's a whirlwind! If you find yourself having to back out, no worries. Here's the lowdown: cancel 24 hours or more ahead and you'll get a refund or transfer, no fuss. If you're within that 24-hour window, or fashionably late and miss the opening ceremony, shoot us an email and we'll graciously \"speed date\" your ticket to the next event as a one-time courtesy. So keep your plans as flexible as a yoga pose, and communicate with us before the event kicks off. No refunds or transfers after the chimes ring and the magic starts!\n\n### Can I sign up with my friend?\n\nAbsolutely! We often have Bring-A-Friend ticket discounts! So thanks for sharing Tantra Speed Date® with your friends! However, do be sure to fill out their name and their email address on the attendee form. Otherwise we will not be able to check them in properly, and they will not receive all the wonderful matches they'll make at the event. If we had a nickel for how many times your friends email us wondering where their matches went... well, you get the picture. So please. Do your friends a solid and fill in their proper details.\n\n### More Questions?\n\nContact us at **help@tantrany.com** we'll be happy to tell you more about this event or others.",

    "description": "Learn the difference between breath, blood, and fantasy chokes and how to best play with each from a harm reduction lens\n\n**Choking education and knowledge is not only for those administering the chokes.**\n\nFor those receiving, you have an opportunity to learn what types of chokes are out there and what sensation you enjoy--or not! Learn the three types of chokes, risks, safety and how to engage in each of them during play.\n\nThere is more to negotiating choking than saying ‘okay we’re both going to choke each other.' Especially when dealing with something that has such a wide range from a light fantasy choke to someone passing out. You may not know what type of choking you or your partners are into and that's okay! The neck is a very sensitive and delicate area. Even so much as resting your hand on your neck can feel invasive, let alone someone else’s.\n\n**What to expect:**\n\nThe first part of the class will be a discussion of safety followed by alternating demonstration and exercises/activities.\n\n**Who should attend:**\n\nThis class is open to people of all skill and experience levels. Come with a partner or solo. Many of the movements can be practiced on yourself, and for those looking to practice with someone there will be a way to do that (although being able to practice with someone you don't know is not guaranteed).\n\n**About the Instructor:**\n\nLola Jean is a sex educator, fetish wrestler, and world record holder for volume squirting.

    "description": "#### Workshop: CARE-FULL: **Week Four: When Things Go Wrong**\n\nKink is inherently risky and there’s no way around it. It doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a seasoned kink veteran - the unexpected _will_ occur. In those moments, the integrity of our systems is put to the test. \n\nSafety is not the absence of incidents or accidents; it’s the presence of barriers and defenses against them. So… how safe are you as a kink partner? What measures do you take to keep your scenes safe? The CARE-FULL series of workshops will provide immense value to your play. \n\nCome to all four workshops or drop in for just one!\n\n#### Week Four: When Things Go Wrong\n\n*   **Post-Incident Process:** Steps to take immediately following an incident to ensure safety and learning. How can we have healthy discussions when harm has been done?\n*   **Accountability & Trust Restoration:** “I’m Sorry” isn’t enough… what happens next?\n*   **Learning from Incidents:** How to analyze incidents to prevent future occurrences and improve practices.\n*   **Just Culture Principles:** Applying just culture concepts to foster a safe and supportive community. When are second chances appropriate? \n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all gender identifications, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. \n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm. Please be on time and text ahead if you are delayed. \n*   You are welcome to wear a mask throughout the duration of the event.\n\n#### After the Workshop:\n\nStick around for our jam session, exclusively open to workshop participants. During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Nix will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Workshop 7:30-9:30 pm - Jam 9:45pm-11:45pm\n\n#### _Near Herald Square / Address given in confirmation email additional info / Elevator Access available at this location_\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n● **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n● **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\nCARE-FULL: Late Summer Series (Thursdays)\n\n1.

    "description": "Hello everyone!\n\nOn 09/14, we’re hosting our next munch!\n\n—\n\n⚔️ Board Game Munch + Post-Event Drinks\n\n📅 Date: Saturday, Sept. 14th, 2024\n\n⏰ Time: 06:00 PM - 11:00 PM\n\n📍 Location: 424 West 54th Street\n\n❄️ Icebreakers: 06:00 PM - 07:00 PM\n\n🍹 Drinks: 11:00 PM - 01:00 AM\n\n—\n\nAre you ready for another unforgettable experience that combines the thrill of board games, the opportunities for learning of our workshops, and the vibrant energy of a welcoming community? Look no further than Geekaholic, the ultimate destination for connoisseurs of kink, geeks, nerds, and newcomers to the vibrant NYC scene!\n\n—\n\n### THINGS TO KNOW:\n\n*   This is a munch, meaning no sex acts will be allowed at this event, and kink is only allowed in the classroom area upstairs during relevant workshops/highlights. However, discussion is allowed and encouraged anywhere during the event! This is a social gathering to meet fellow geeks and kinksters and enjoy a fun evening of games and conversation. Full rules can be found [here](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/rules).\n*   As always, this event is open to anyone and everyone to attend. We aim to create a safe space for members of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community and other marginalized groups. If anyone ever makes you feel unsafe at our events, please reach out to our staff.\n*   Our events are at a _dedicated_ venue at Prime Produce Co-op and are graciously hosted by PLAN Gaming ([https://www.plangaming.org/](https://www.plangaming.org/)), which is a non-profit incubator. All people present in the space will specifically be there for this event, so we can talk openly about kink and related topics.\n*   At Geekaholic, we believe in making our events accessible to everyone, so Geekaholic Munches operate on a \"Pay What You Can\" model. While we suggest a donation of $20, every contribution helps us sustain our partnership with Prime Produce and helps enrich our own future event programming.\n*   The space houses 90 games in its library and counting (see the full list on our [discord](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/discord)). But also, feel free to bring your own games! All board game skill levels, from newbie onward, are welcome!\n*   Our venue has a dedicated café on premises, but everyone is welcome to bring their own food/drinks as well. See the related section below for more info on our special menu offerings!\n*   We usually play board games for about five hours and then go for drinks at a nearby bar. Everyone (21+) is welcome for both!\n*   Most of attendees RSVP on fetlife. And we average at least 50 in person attendees. Feel free to RSVP there as well if you have an account, but an account is not required to attend our events. Fetlife event link: [https://fetlife.com/events/1562008](https://fetlife.com/events/1562008)\n\n—\n\n### ✨ **_August Highlights_**✨\n\nTBA\n\n—\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):**\n\n📍 **Am I at the right place?**\n\n_The building is unmarked since it's an event space and food co-op office normally (because hey, New York). Come into 424 West 54th Street and find our signup desk right at the entrance._\n\n🎭 **What is a Munch?**\n\n_A BDSM munch is a friendly, social gathering of people interested in BDSM or kink. It is a good event for newcomers, providing a safe space to learn, socialize and establish a rapport within the kink community. There is no nudity or sex, just fellow kinksters talking (and playing games!) - feel free to dress comfortably. We focus on creating a welcoming environment for everyone!_\n\n😨 **I’m feeling nervous! I’ve never been to something like this.**\n\n_Don't_ h_esitate to get in touch with us and let us know! We’ll take steps to introduce you to others and make you more comfortable. Don’t worry, all you’ll find is a bunch of people with similar interests playing games and having fun! If you have any questions about the event, send us a DM!_\n\n🍔 **Can we bring our own food, drinks, and/or beer?**\n\n_Yes! Even though we have a cafe on premises, you are welcome to bring anything to eat and drink._\n\n⚓ **What is “Cruising” and why is it prohibited at our events?**\n\n“_Cruising” involves either mass messaging attendees or attending events solely with the intent of soliciting casual sex or advertising other events and not seeking meaningful connections. In a BDSM munch, this goes against the respectful, consensual nature. Munches prioritize building connections, fostering community, and open conversations, not pursuing purely sexual encounters._\n\n📅 **How can I stay up to date with upcoming events?**\n\n_Stay connected and be the first to know about our monthly Tabletop RPG sessions, munches, road trips, parties, and more by joining our FetLife group_ [_here_](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/fetlife-group)\n\n📞 **Is there a way to stay in touch with everyone I meet?**\n\n_Absolutely! Connect with your friends and fellow attendees through our Geekaholic Discord server_ [_here_](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/discord)\n\n💨 **Is Marijuana/Vaping allowed?**\n\n_Feel free to step outside to smoke. Smoking indoors is prohibited, so please be considerate of those who may not partake._\n\n🔞 **Will I need to be over 21 to attend?**\n\n_No. You can attend as long as you're over 18. However, for the purchase/consumption of alcoholic beverages, you must present valid photo identification showing you are 21 or older to comply with NY state laws._\n\n📣 **How do I get involved or support the Geekaholic community?**\n\n_Thank you for asking! We are always looking for new volunteers and staff members! If you are interested, please fill out this form_ [_here_](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/volunteer)\n\n—\n\n### **Rules and Guidelines**\n\nNote: Geekaholic munches are exclusively for individuals aged 18 and above. We prioritize safety, consent, and inclusivity for all attendees. Familiarize yourself with our community guidelines below to ensure an extraordinary experience.\n\n📜 [Munch Regulations & Guidelines](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/rules)\n\n—\n\n_\\*Visit our linktree_ [_here_](https://linktr.ee/geekaholicnyc)\n\n_\\*Follow our fetlife group_ [_here_](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/fetlife-group)\n\n_\\*Join our discord community_ [_here_](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/discord)",

    "description": "Hosted by [Nix the Sirenatrix](https://www.instagram.com/the.sirenatrix) & Pagans Paradise Crew\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**The theme of this months Sapphic Sirens party is Back 2 School!!**\n\nStep into a world of playful nostalgia with our \"Back to School\" kink party! Relive the thrill of your school days with a naughty twist. Get ready to embrace the energy of classroom crushes, mischievous pranks, and after-school delights. Dance to the beats of your favorite school anthems while exploring themed areas that bring out your inner teacher's pet or rebellious student. Whether you're rocking a classic uniform or channeling your favorite school character, this night is all about reliving the excitement of the first day back. Sharpen your pencils, grab your hall pass, and get ready for a night of fun, flirtation, and kink at the ultimate \"Back to School\" party!\n\n(Any questions, more info/details and community guidelines please see [PagansParadise.com](https://pagansparadise.com/))\n\nWelcome to a mesmerizing evening at Sapphic Sirens, where we celebrate the splendor of sapphic connections. This event is a haven for women, trans, and non-binary/GNC individuals to enjoy camaraderie, community, pleasure, and playful moments. We encourage you to dress like the goddesses you are and prepare for a night of indulgence. We’re committed to creating a safe and welcoming space to facilitate new relationships, exploration, and fulfillment of desires! Good vibes only — or else! ;)\n\n### Who Can Attend\n\nSAPPHICS (21+). If you do not fit the below definition, please do not come. This is meant to be an intentional space for sapphics to meet other sapphics. For everyone else, there are other Pagans Paradise events that you’ll love. Obviously, enforcing this policy is tricky, but we will trust attendees to respect our space and our intentions.\n\n> (Definition from [LGBTQIA+ Wiki](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Sapphic)) Sapphic, sometimes known as women loving women (WLW),or sapphist, refers to a woman or woman-aligned person of any sexual orientation who is attracted to women or woman aligned genders/gender identities. We mean to be specifically inclusive of non-binary people. It is an umbrella term for many identities, including those who are lesbian, pansexual, bisexual, or queer. It is used to promote solidarity among women and non-binary people of all identities who are attracted to those who are women and woman-aligned. It may also be used as an identity, and may be found particularly useful for individuals who know they are attracted to women but may be uncertain if they are attracted to other genders. It can also be used to describe a relationship between two women.\n\n**Ultimately, we reserve the right to remove anyone, sapphic or not, for any reason** - this is usually a last resort consequence of a breach of our Community Guidelines. Please respect this privileged space and treat it as your own home.\n\n### The Night will feature:\n\n*   Orientation: Nix, our host, will review guidelines about consent & mutual desire to ensure we’re all on the same page and will respect this privileged safe space. We’ll also explain the different rooms, play stations, and group activities throughout the night.\n*   Icebreakers: To facilitate new friendships and manifest fantasies, attendees will give a brief introduction including name, pronouns, and speak out loud any desires for the night. Note - this does not guarantee that your dreams will come true - and we discourage transactional Desperate D\\*ck/Predatory P\\*ssy energy! … but wishing out loud increases the chances of magic happening!\n*   A spectacular performance by burlesque queen Rita-n-Wink! (showering her with love in the form of dollar bills highly appreciated and encouraged)\n*   A wide variety of goodies sold by [Pretty Tokers](https://www.instagram.com/prettytokers.official)! \n*   SAPPHIC Room: sensual & light, for massage, oils, etc.\n*   SIREN Room: kinky & dark, impact, rope, etc.\n*   Bracelet system: back by popular demand, our bracelet system can help match you to folks with compatible interests. We’ll explain how this works during the orientation!\n*   Facilitators: We’ll have knowledgeable and approachable facilitators around to monitor safety and answer any questions.\n*   Limitations and Comfort: Everyone can engage according to their comfort level. There will be different rooms with different vibes, a hall to mingle in, and a low-stim chill room. Attendees can participate or just watch! Pagans Paradise is known for the welcoming, inclusive atmosphere that caters to newbies and scene veterans alike.\n\n### What to Bring:\n\n*   Dress to impress\n*   BYOB / BYO-toys\n*   $$$ for vendors & performers (Thank you for supporting our community’s artists and entrepreneurs!)\n\n### **Ticket Prices**\n\n*   Early Bird $30\n*   Tier 1 $40\n*   Tier 2 $50\n*   At Door $60\n*   No refunds, if you cannot make it feel free to sell/donate ticket\n\n### **Schedule**\n\n*   7:30PM - 8:30PM: Mingling\n*   8:29PM: DOORS CLOSE (we mean it - please message in advance if this is an issue so we can expect you) \n*   8:30PM - Orientation, Icebreaker, and Performance(s)\n*   9:00PM - 1:00AM: Enjoy the various rooms of the space, each with different vibes.

    "description": "Does the thought of getting frisky in public excite you? Learn covert and overt ways to play when you're out and about. All welcome.\n\nDoes the thought of getting frisky in public excite you?\n\n\"Playing in Public\" means any type of play (doesn't have to be explicitly s\\*xual) that's in public. Yes, there's a possibility of someone seeing you BUT being discovered/seen may or may not be your intent. Public play can also be with a partner(s) or on your own. Let's explore the possibilities and ways of playing in public in new and exciting ways!\n\n**In this class, you will learn**\n\n\\- how to unleash your inner exhibitionist\n\n\\- how to improve your or your partner's comfort if you/they are a non-exhibitionist (AKA covert play)\n\n\\- how to improve your own or your partner's comfort in public\n\n\\- tips for how to play overtly or covertly in public (no one has to be the wiser!)\n\n\\- tips for location ideas, from beginner to more advanced\n\n\\- tips for personal play in public and/or playing with another/others\n\n\\- tips for dressing/undressing quickly\n\n\\- suggestions for toys and other helpful play tools\n\n\\- tips for edging, games, and \"tasks\"\n\n\\- how to keep leveling up your public s\\*xploration, if that's your goal\n\n\\- how to pinpoint your strongest org@sm triggers so you can get your freak on faster, easier, and anywhere\n\n\\- how be safer and more prudent (AKA how to avoid getting caught!)\n\n**Level**\n\nThis class is for everyone! Exhibitionists and non-exhibitionists alike will find plenty of ideas for how to play in public to their level of comfort and excitement.\n\n**Format**\n\nThis is an organized class that incorporates visuals (PowerPoint and demonstrations), explanations and class participation. Demonstrations will include ways to covertly and overtly play in public including ways to dress & items to carry to optimize for covert/overt play, ideas for things to wear beneath your clothes, toys to incorporate, and more.\n\n**Who should attend**\n\nAll gender identities and relationship types (singles, solo poly, couples, polycules, and more) are welcome. Many ideas were created for myself early in my k!nk exploration when I, as a non-exhibitionist, was trying to find ways to play with and be comfortable with exhibitionist play partners in front of an audience.\n\n**What to bring**\n\nPlease bring a notebook and a pen/pencil to take notes. There will be a rope demo- feel free to bring 10-20ft of 1/4\"-1\" diameter rope if you'd like to follow along with a rope demo (nylon and cotton rope is super cheap, available online and will work well). I will also share a video after the class of this demo.\n\n**What to wear**\n\nI encourage everyone to wear what makes them feel good. I'll be dressing/undressing and demonstrating ways to use toys as well as other things that you and/or your partner may like.\n\n**About Your Instructor**\n\n[Knotasha](https://www.instagram.com/knotashanyc/) (she/her) is a s\\*x educator and fet!sh model who has been actively in the k\\*nk scene for a decade. For over 8 years, she has taught and co-taught at venues and k\\*nky conventions such as HitMeUp Academy, K\\*nk dot com, Soho House, Westcoast Bound, KinkFest, Thunder in the Mountains, and DomCon.

    "description": "Share loving touch in a safe space\n\nThis is an opportunity to connect with others, engage in spiritual healing and welcome the divine through positive touch within a safe space.\n\nLocation\n\nNew York City, NY. Address provided after ticket purchase.\n\nDate and Time\n\nFri, Oct 4th at 7:00 PM to 11:45 PM. Doors will open at 7:00 PM and close at 7:30 PM. BE ON TIME as nobody will be admitted after the doors close to preserve the sanctity of the container we create. Everyone must be present for the opening circle. You may leave at any time. There will be an optional closing circle around 11:00 PM.\n\nLight snacks will be provided. This is a clean and sober event.\n\nCovid-19 Policies\n\nPlease do not attend if you have any symptoms. All attendees are encouraged to be fully vaccinated. Please only attend if you are okay with being in a group of people indoors, regardless of their personal health choices or decisions to wear masks.\n\nWhat is a Temple Party?\n\nWe believe our bodies are sacred spaces and any time we dive into our deeper levels of consciousness and connect in ways that ignite our spirits, this is a sacred practice. Boundaries and consent are foremost, and we will provide guidelines for everyone to engage and still feel safe.\n\nA Temple Party is an opportunity to grow spiritually, play, explore, connect with people, and most of all to have fun. You might just want to observe (observing is a valid form of participation), or you might want to share light touch and cuddling or healing massage. You get to decide what you want to do, and you do not have to do anything you are uncomfortable with. You do not have to touch or interact with anyone unless you want to. All activities must be safe, sane and consensual, and within the boundaries we have set.\n\nWe adhere to common community guidelines and do not allow inappropriate behavior.\n\nWho Should Attend?\n\nAll persons 21 or older regardless of orientation, race, ability or religion. If you are open-minded and interested in sharing loving touch, we welcome you. If you are just curious but don’t want to play, you are welcome to come experience the atmosphere. Nobody will touch you without your verbal consent.\n\nWe expect everyone who attends to be able to abide by our guidelines and respect boundaries. Attendees should be able to communicate clearly with others and know their own limitations. We expect a level of emotional maturity and spiritual awareness that will allow you to function in a group setting.\n\nWhat to Wear\n\nDress in something comfortable! You will want to wear something you can easily move around in. Shoes will be left at the door.\n\nPlease do not use any scented products or perfumes before coming to the party to respect those with sensitivities to fragrance.\n\nWhat to Bring\n\nWe will have an area set aside for your belongings. Bring a water bottle (only closed-lid bottles containing water will be allowed in the play areas).\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nThis will be a relaxed, playful event. We will have an opening circle where we establish our container for the evening. We will review guidelines and discuss boundaries, followed by a brief ice-breaker activity. After that you will be free to explore on your own. Facilitators will be available to help guide your spiritual practices and ensure everyone stays within the boundaries we have set.\n\nExpect to have a fun evening and connect with some like-minded individuals. You get to decide how to participate. This is a safe space where participants are encouraged to explore themselves and others in ways that are spiritual, healthy, stimulating, nurturing, exciting, safe, consensual and fun!",

Check out the [FAQ on our website](https://tantrany.com/speed-dating/?aff=4ebfaq) (bottom of page)!\n\n### What is Tantra, and why \"Tantra\" Speed Date?\n\nForget those wild myths and blockbuster misunderstandings; Tantra is more about connection, fun, and being present than anything risqué. Imagine it as the art of \"relationship yoga,\" blending age-old practices with a twist of joy and mindfulness. Through exercises like breathing, meditating, and maybe even a little dancing, you'll find yourself more in tune with those around you. It's like a social superpower for making genuine connections, and trust us, it's a blast! After all, we find this level of presence is exactly what's missing from most dating encounters today. Why just talk when you can laugh, connect, and explore together?\n\n### What does this style of dating look like?\n\nPicture this: You'll form two fun-filled circles of fellow daters. The men make up the outer ring, and the women form the inner ring; so that you're paired off with a friendly face across from you. Together, you'll dive into engaging and heartfelt mini-dates (we call them 'dating stations') that last just long enough to spark a connection. After each experience, you'll bring your hands into a cheerful 'Namaste', share a quick thank you, and then — whoosh! — off to the next exciting meeting. Keep circling around, and by the end, you'll have met everyone.\n\n### What kinds of exercises will I do?\n\nNo clichéd icebreakers here! Our exercises are all about authentic human connection, not cheesy romance. We're talking engaging dialogue, light partner yoga, movement/dance, heartwarming eye-gazing, and even some gentle hand-holding. It's a delightful mix that goes beyond the mundane 'what's your job' chatter.\n\nThe coolest part? Every exercise is wrapped around a positive relating skill. So, not only will you have a blast, you'll be building real relationship skills too! And remember consent, you're the boss of how you participate. It's all about fun and connection in a way that feels good for you.\n\n### What if one of the exercises is not my cup of tea?\n\nThanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify, or completely opt out. Everyone is encouraged to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators do a fabulous job demonstrating what that looks like, so it feels good for everyone.\n\n### So how does this all add up to dating?\n\nGreat question! Think of it as a refreshing twist on the traditional dating scene. You'll get to interact, laugh, and connect with others, and then decide who you'd like to get to know better. We put a fun spin on things by letting the ladies take the lead in choosing; they'll place one of their beads in each man's pouch that they want to connect with. They'll get a feel for the guys' personalities and presence, while the men are guided on how to be grounded and open-hearted. Afterwards, either party can contact the other. It's all about letting connections unfold naturally.\n\n### What is the schedule?\n\n*   **Doors Open**: Right at the start time, we'll check you in, hand over your dating materials, and give you a playing card for a super fun Ice Breaker game. You've got until the stations begin to mix and mingle!\n*   **20 minutes in**: Time to let in folks from the waiting list, making sure everything's balanced and ready to roll.\n*   **30 minutes in**: Ice Breaker game wraps up, and the doors close. Now the real fun begins as we kick off the event. Be sure to check in before this time, or you'll miss out on all the excitement! (Running late or need to cancel? Check our policy below.)\n*   **End of the Night**: You'll feel the warm glow of connection and may not want it to end. While we'll gently nudge you toward the door, it's common for guests to join together for dinner, continuing the connections and conversations. Who knows? Your night might just be getting started!\n\n### What should I wear?\n\nThink comfort with a touch of your best self! You'll be sitting and also moving, so choose an outfit that lets you feel relaxed but still sharp. Just remember, it's a date, so grooming matters. And go easy on strong scents; some people are sensitive.\n\n### Is there food or drink at the event?\n\nWe usually don't serve food or drinks (unless it's a special event), so feel free to bring a water bottle. Snacks might be good for before or after, but check with the venue, as some don't allow food. As tempting as a quick bite during the event might be, you'll want all your attention on your dates. And remember, alcohol is a no-go, so please arrive with a clear and ready mind.\n\n### How many dates will I have?\n\nGet ready for a lively evening with up to 20 opportunities to connect! Our events typically max out at around 40 singles. Assuming a balanced mix, you'll have the chance to spark a connection with up to 20 different people. And, we're all about quality not quantity. You'll find each moment meaningful as you dive into engaging exchanges with others who, just like you, are looking to explore connection and authenticity.\n\n### What is the gender balance at the event?\n\nWe don't believe in leaving anyone out of the fun, so we do our best to aim for an equal gender balance. Of course, it isn't always 100% under our control--even our matchmaking powers have their limits. But so far, just about every event has been sold out. And since we have an equal number of tickets per gender, they've all had a solid mix of singles ready to mingle! (We also occasionally use door sales magic to balance the gender too.)\n\n### What if I don't match with anyone?\n\nAs many of our attendees say, \"I don't even care if I match with anyone, this was amazing!\" That said, we geek out on data. Our statistics say there is a 94.09% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if for whatever reason the probability fails you, we've got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!\n\n### What is the age range?\n\nSome events have a suggested age range (noted in the title and description) and some are open to all ages. Whether you're a little outside the range or just curious about meeting people within it, you're welcome here.\n\nOur most popular events are open to all ages, drawing a vibrant and diverse crowd. Singles 30-45 tend to be the largest group. Followed by folks 45+ and then 20s. And while age might be a curiosity, what truly sets our events apart is the connection experience.\n\nBut here's the thing. It's more than just about the dates. And this is what makes Tantra Speed Date® unique. Singles everywhere rave about how the experience itself can be quite transformative, regardless of their matches. Why? Simply engaging consciously with other singles in a positive and structured way promotes more healthy relationships. And it just plain feels good to connect with real people. You likely have never experienced dating in such a fun and comfortable way. You'll gain confidence, pick up new skills, and will likely start to attract more quality people into your life. That's what our participants say over and over again!\n\n### Will there be enough people?\n\nDon't let low RSVPs in one spot fool you. Our events often sell out faster than you can say \"Namaste,\" and often with a waiting list. We're keen to promote across various platforms, and they don't all show the same love. Rest assured, we make sure there's always a crowd worth your while. So come on down; your next amazing connection could be just one RSVP away!\n\n### Do I have to be single to attend?\n\nAh, the modern relationship landscape—a tapestry of statuses! While you don't need to be 'single' in the traditional sense, you do need to be in a space where romantic connections are possible. If you're already committed and not open to new love, you may want to consider our couples events. But if you find your heart's door ajar, even just a smidge—or if you're teetering on the edge of 'ready to date'—this could be the perfect space to explore what's possible. Consider this your invitation to a playground of connection, perfect for testing the waters!\n\n### Is this a heterosexual event and is there a Queer/LGBTQ Tantra Speed Date?\n\nDiversity is the spice of life, and we're cooking up all kinds of flavors! This classic version of Tantra Speed Date® is primarily designed for men-seeking-women and women-seeking-men. In this setup you'll find yourself in one of two gendered circles—one for men and one for women. You'll rotate through up to 20 dates with members of the opposite gender. But don't fret, fabulous queer friends! We also host Queer Tantra Speed Date events in select cities. So if you're looking for a rainbow connection, keep an eye on our website to see when we're bringing that magic to a city near you!\n\n### What is your cancellation/refund policy?\n\nWe get it—life's a whirlwind! If you find yourself having to back out, no worries. Here's the lowdown: cancel 24 hours or more ahead and you'll get a refund or transfer, no fuss. If you're within that 24-hour window, or fashionably late and miss the opening ceremony, shoot us an email and we'll graciously \"speed date\" your ticket to the next event as a one-time courtesy. So keep your plans as flexible as a yoga pose, and communicate with us before the event kicks off. No refunds or transfers after the chimes ring and the magic starts!\n\n### Can I sign up with my friend?\n\nAbsolutely! We often have Bring-A-Friend ticket discounts! So thanks for sharing Tantra Speed Date® with your friends! However, do be sure to fill out their name and their email address on the attendee form. Otherwise we will not be able to check them in properly, and they will not receive all the wonderful matches they'll make at the event. If we had a nickel for how many times your friends email us wondering where their matches went... well, you get the picture. So please. Do your friends a solid and fill in their proper details.\n\n### More Questions?\n\nContact us at **help@tantrany.com** we'll be happy to tell you more about this event or others.",

After that you will be free to explore on your own. Facilitators will be available to help guide your spiritual practices and ensure everyone stays within the boundaries we have set.\n\nExpect to have a fun evening and connect with some like-minded individuals. You get to decide how to participate.

Dance beneath the moonlit sky with otherworldly beings, including seductive nymphs and bewitching witches, each embodying the magical and mysterious essence of the night. Let the night awaken your deepest desires as you venture through themed areas designed to captivate your senses. Whether you're draped in ethereal fabrics, adorned with nature-inspired accessories, or channeling the power of a dark sorceress, this evening is all about celebrating the magic of the nocturnal. Unleash your inner nymph or witch and let the night guide you through a world of sensual exploration and unforgettable encounters.\n\n(Any questions, more info/details and community guidelines please see [PagansParadise.com](https://pagansparadise.com/))\n\nWelcome to a mesmerizing evening at Sapphic Sirens, where we celebrate the splendor of sapphic connections. This event is a haven for women, trans, and non-binary/GNC individuals to enjoy camaraderie, community, pleasure, and playful moments. We encourage you to dress like the goddesses you are and prepare for a night of indulgence. We’re committed to creating a safe and welcoming space to facilitate new relationships, exploration, and fulfillment of desires! Good vibes only — or else! ;)\n\n### Who Can Attend\n\nSAPPHICS (21+). If you do not fit the below definition, please do not come. This is meant to be an intentional space for sapphics to meet other sapphics. For everyone else, there are other Pagans Paradise events that you’ll love. Obviously, enforcing this policy is tricky, but we will trust attendees to respect our space and our intentions.\n\n> (Definition from [LGBTQIA+ Wiki](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Sapphic)) Sapphic, sometimes known as women loving women (WLW),or sapphist, refers to a woman or woman-aligned person of any sexual orientation who is attracted to women or woman aligned genders/gender identities. We mean to be specifically inclusive of non-binary people. It is an umbrella term for many identities, including those who are lesbian, pansexual, bisexual, or queer. It is used to promote solidarity among women and non-binary people of all identities who are attracted to those who are women and woman-aligned. It may also be used as an identity, and may be found particularly useful for individuals who know they are attracted to women but may be uncertain if they are attracted to other genders. It can also be used to describe a relationship between two women.\n\n**Ultimately, we reserve the right to remove anyone, sapphic or not, for any reason** - this is usually a last resort consequence of a breach of our Community Guidelines. Please respect this privileged space and treat it as your own home.\n\n### The Night will feature:\n\n*   Orientation: Nix, our host, will review guidelines about consent & mutual desire to ensure we’re all on the same page and will respect this privileged safe space. We’ll also explain the different rooms, play stations, and group activities throughout the night.\n*   Icebreakers: To facilitate new friendships and manifest fantasies, attendees will give a brief introduction including name, pronouns, and speak out loud any desires for the night. Note - this does not guarantee that your dreams will come true - and we discourage transactional Desperate D\\*ck/Predatory P\\*ssy energy! … but wishing out loud increases the chances of magic happening!\n*   A spectacular performance by burlesque queen Rita-n-Wink! (showering her with love in the form of dollar bills highly appreciated and encouraged)\n*   A wide variety of goodies sold by [Pretty Tokers](https://www.instagram.com/prettytokers.official)! \n*   SAPPHIC Room: sensual & light, for massage, oils, etc.\n*   SIREN Room: kinky & dark, impact, rope, etc.\n*   Bracelet system: back by popular demand, our bracelet system can help match you to folks with compatible interests. We’ll explain how this works during the orientation!\n*   Facilitators: We’ll have knowledgeable and approachable facilitators around to monitor safety and answer any questions.\n*   Limitations and Comfort: Everyone can engage according to their comfort level. There will be different rooms with different vibes, a hall to mingle in, and a low-stim chill room. Attendees can participate or just watch! Pagans Paradise is known for the welcoming, inclusive atmosphere that caters to newbies and scene veterans alike.\n\n### What to Bring:\n\n*   Dress to impress\n*   BYOB / BYO-toys\n*   $$$ for vendors & performers (Thank you for supporting our community’s artists and entrepreneurs!)\n\n### **Ticket Prices**\n\n*   Early Bird $30\n*   Tier 1 $40\n*   Tier 2 $50\n*   At Door $60\n*   No refunds, if you cannot make it feel free to sell/donate ticket\n\n### **Schedule**\n\n*   7:30PM - 8:30PM: Mingling\n*   8:29PM: DOORS CLOSE (we mean it - please message in advance if this is an issue so we can expect you) \n*   8:30PM - Orientation, Icebreaker, and Performance(s)\n*   9:00PM - 1:00AM: Enjoy the various rooms of the space, each with different vibes.

A beautiful and sacred ancient ritual that has been practiced for thousands of years.\n\nIt is a beautiful ceremony of honoring and adoring the Divine that dwells within each of us, and brings us into a profound space of connection and universal Love.\n\nThis experience welcomes everyone, all faiths, and orientations.\n\nView the image gallery under the Discussion tab to get an idea what the experience will be like. (Pics and Videos from the last one)\n\nStep into a world of acceptance and sensation where all of you is welcome. Each person is invited into magical connections to expand your experience/capacity of giving and receiving. The ritual begins the moment you enter as you are celebrated, seen and adored for ALL you are.\n\nThis evening’s ceremony is dedicated to all genders. In fact, participants will not know whether they will be in the giving or receiving role until they arrive. We will use movement, sound and the five elements, all given to us with ample instruction, enriching each experience throughout the evening. You may find yourself turning inwards and becoming aware of abundant love and innate beauty that is part of your being.\n\nThis ceremony opens people's hearts in a way that allows them to see the inner beauty and the Divine within us all. The participants in the giving role will be instructed in performing an ancient ritual, which is simple in form yet very powerful in practice. As the participants in the receiving role accept the offerings and adoration, they in turn connect with unconditional love and reflect that adoration back to the givers with their presence. Taking part in these rituals is a very powerful way to reconnect and relate with all aspects of ourselves. It is through the practice of unconditional loving that we find that any emptiness or longing we feel within us can be filled with a simple act of giving.\n\nThis ancient ritual is thousands of years old. It was brought to life by those who implemented the practice of breathing life and awareness through the five elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Ether) in offering to the divine within every living being. We will offer fire, incense, roses, water, chocolate and more in adoration and worship of our divine essence.\n\nWe welcome you to reclaim your space and powerful place in the world as we unveil your deepest core. You will leave enchanted having fallen more deeply in love with YOU.\n\nWith open hearts and deep connection you will be \"rebirthed\" from a place of complete vulnerability and fullness as you choose to wake up to YOU!\n\nThis is a non-sxxual experience and welcomes everyone, singles will rotate, and couples may stay together if they want.\n\nLove Exchange: $89 a person\n\nGet your tickets here we often sell out\n\nLIMIT 30 STATIONS\n\nRSVP :\n\nWhat others have said about This Ceremony:\n\n\"Heart opening, will make you cry, have your energy flow through every pore, try it on\"\n\n\"Not knowing what to expect upon entering this illuminated room, I found myself being honored and revered in the most sacred way. I left feeling most loved. Thank you for the gift of myself\"\n\n\"A very supportive group to encourage claiming our full freedom and outrageous loveliness\"\n\n\"Don't ask, just go!! Serenity, grace, and fullness await\"\n\n\"I saw myself as a person capable of loving someone and being loved, realized my mom and dad ARE proud of me, I see in me the person I was always meant to be\"\n\n\"Sending out big hugs to Monique Darling for hosting such a beautiful Ceremony. You know, we all live in a world in which we are over worked and often under-appreciated. This ritual was an opportunity to have one's heart filled up with unconditional love. It was a transformative event, and I highly recommend it to everyone, whether you are woo-woo like me or not. Together we practiced giving and receiving non-sensual adoration. For example, we bathed each other's feet, fed each other chocolate, and showered words of affirmation on each other. We also opened up our hearts to speak vulnerable truths. At one point, we were invited to let go of something we no longer needed. I lit a small candle, and into it I whispered the words, \"I let go of the need to be right.\" And then with one breath, I blew out the flame and let it go!\" ~ Gayle Roberts, San Francisco\n\n\"Wow, the Adoration Ceremony was so much more powerful than I imagined. I arrived nervous, shy, and unsure of what might happen, and I emerged filled with gratitude, radiance, joy, and many new friends. Thank you Monique, for this incredible gift\"\n\n\"Monique's Adoration Ceremony was an experience to remember. Allowing Sacred Space for all to express themselves in whatever ways they needed to heal and come into their own sacred divinity.\"\n\n\"The Art of Adoration Ceremony created a nurturing environment that invited so much release. I feel like parts of my soul have been born again\"\n\nRSVP Here:\n\nWANT MORE? Join Monique, Peter and special guests for all of the yummy events while they’re in New York...

    "description": "Rope play has the capacity to empower and inspire both the giver and the receiver\n\nRSVP to save your spot:\n\nUnravel. Surrender. Receive.\n\n\"To tie is to embrace.\" - Arisue Go\n\nRope play is a form of sensual bondage. It is an art of connection and seduction, surrender and control, with both ancient roots and modern techniques. Rope play has the capacity to empower and inspire both the giver and the receiver. For the one bound in rope it can at times be paradoxically a very relaxing experience, not unlike swaddling a small baby. At other times being bound, tied, and released can flood the body with endorphins and adrenaline creating highly charged, ecstatic states. For the one doing the tying, rope becomes an extension of his or her hands. It is possible to create almost an infinite number of sensations with rope, from slow and sensual, to rough and biting. By cultivating energetic flow states, a deep sense of connection can develop between rope play partners.\n\nIntimate LEADERSHIP & empowered SURRENDER:\n\nan introductory rope and energy play class.\n\nIt is a small group workshop created for participants desiring a safe and welcoming introduction to ropes while exploring their emotional edges and learning how to confidently take and surrender control.\n\nIn the process, participants will learn about themselves through connection to their deepest and most vulnerable core. After all, it is only by releasing control that we can unleash our full potential, and only by stepping into our power can we invite another to give up theirs.\n\nThrough a combination of tantric practices, sacred sxxuality, and consent- and trauma-informed coaching, this shibari and energetic journey will guide you into an altered state of consciousness that allows for your deepest transformation in confidence, self-acceptance, and sensual expression.\n\nRina will teach a simple, but deceptively powerful style of rope play that require no knowledge of complicated knots. She’ll guide you through the basics of rope safety. She and Monique will offer simple techniques for using rope to cultivate energy and power exchange between consenting adults. Our focus is on using rope as a tool for helping partners develop emotional connection, intimacy, and trust.\n\nNo prior rope play experience is required. Basic energy play or power exchange experience is helpful, but not necessary. Couples and singles of all genders and orientations are welcomed. Uncoupled singles will be paired with other singles. Each participant will learn to tie and be tied. Rope and mats will be provided for those who don’t already have them.\n\nYou'll learn from two world-class practitioners one, former pro-domme, and the second a tantrika that has led over 3,000 workshops around the world. When you leave, hopefully you will have gained greater access to energy, surrender, play, and also will have gained the skills to practice shibari confidently, safely, and with a greater awareness of your and your partner's emotional needs in intimacy.\n\nLove Exchange $109 single $99 early bird and $169 for pairs\n\nTime 7-10:30 pm\n\nThis is a sensual event, but not sxxual, so bottoms will remain on for this weorkshop. We have several temple parties the weekend before where bottoms can come off ;)\n\nRSVP HERE:\n\nIf you would prefer to pay with Venmo or Paypal please text Monique here 619 601 8852, and she will send you the proper info to pay and register for the event.

Instead of leaving you to your guesses and assumptions, I will try to clarify what a shibari journey with me really is. My agenda is to offer a SACRED JOURNEY INTO VULNERABILITY. My journeys are a dance of technical skills and intuitive flow. Intuitive flow leads the way, while technical skills are ever-present for safe, practical applications.”\n\nRina is Austin's premier shibari instructor. A former professional dominatrix with twelve years' experience working with elite New York City clients, Rina has now redirected her conscious kink career toward providing vulnerability journeys through rope.\n\nTying together eleven years of tantric bodywork and meditation practices in Asia, Rina studies and performs shibari with the most celebrated masters in Japan and across the United States.\n\nA University of Maryland MBA graduate, certified death doula, and NLP and trauma-informed hypnotherapy practitioner, Rina combines her breadth of knowledge across somatic, spiritual, and sexual disciplines toward an utterly unique shibari modality that invites clients to access their deepest self-discovery and spiritual illumination.\n\nA freediver, BASE jumper, skydiver, student of ancient traditions, and self-described intrepid explorer of consciousness, Rina is also the creator of Underline | World (https://underline.world/), an online tantric immersion course, and appears frequently on podcasts for her work in vulnerability coaching and sacred sexuality.\n\nHer mission is to acquaint you with your own self: raw, unmasked, and intimately tied to your own truth.
