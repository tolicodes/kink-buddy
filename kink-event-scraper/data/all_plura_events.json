    "description": "#### Workshop: CARE-FULL: **Week Three: Managing Unknowns**¬†\n\nKink is inherently risky and there‚Äôs no way around it. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are a beginner or a seasoned kink veteran - the unexpected _will_ occur. In those moments, the integrity of our systems is put to the test.¬†\n\nSafety is not the absence of incidents or accidents; it‚Äôs the presence of barriers and defenses against them. So‚Ä¶ how safe are you as a kink partner? What measures do you take to keep your scenes safe? The CARE-FULL series of workshops will provide immense value to your play.¬†\n\nCome to all four workshops or drop in for just one!\n\n#### **Week Three: Managing Unknowns**\n\n*   **Risk vs Uncertainty:** Understanding the difference and its implications in kink scenes.\n*   **Conducting Risk Assessments:** How to evaluate and manage potential risks in your play.\n*   **Contingency Planning:** Preparing backup plans for various scenarios.\n*   **Adapting to the Unexpected:** Techniques for staying flexible and responsive during scenes.\n*   **Blindspots and Common Mistakes:** Identifying and avoiding common pitfalls in risk management.\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback.¬†\n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios.¬†\n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all gender identifications, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event.¬†\n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm. Please be on time and text ahead if you are delayed.¬†\n*   You are welcome to wear a mask throughout the duration of the event.\n\n#### After the Workshop:\n\nStick around for our jam session, exclusively open to workshop participants. During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Nix will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Workshop 7:30-9:30 pm - Jam 9:45pm-11:45pm\n\n#### _Near Herald Square / Address given in confirmation email additional info / Elevator Access available at this location_\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n‚óè **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n‚óè **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\nCARE-FULL: Late Summer Series (Thursdays)\n\n1.  Scene Planning & Negotiation (Aug 22)\n2.  Aftercare & Debriefs (Aug 29)\n3.  Managing Unknowns (Sep 5)\n4.  When Things Go Wrong (Sep 12)",

Check out the [FAQ on our website](https://tantrany.com/speed-dating/?aff=4ebfaq) (bottom of page)!\n\n### What is Tantra, and why \"Tantra\" Speed Date?\n\nForget those wild myths and blockbuster misunderstandings; Tantra is more about connection, fun, and being present than anything risqu√©. Imagine it as the art of \"relationship yoga,\" blending age-old practices with a twist of joy and mindfulness. Through exercises like breathing, meditating, and maybe even a little dancing, you'll find yourself more in tune with those around you. It's like a social superpower for making genuine connections, and trust us, it's a blast! After all, we find this level of presence is exactly what's missing from most dating encounters today. Why just talk when you can laugh, connect, and explore together?\n\n### What does this style of dating look like?\n\nPicture this: You'll form two fun-filled circles of fellow daters. The men make up the outer ring, and the women form the inner ring; so that you're paired off with a friendly face across from you. Together, you'll dive into engaging and heartfelt mini-dates (we call them 'dating stations') that last just long enough to spark a connection. After each experience, you'll bring your hands into a cheerful 'Namaste', share a quick thank you, and then ‚Äî whoosh! ‚Äî off to the next exciting meeting. Keep circling around, and by the end, you'll have met everyone.\n\n### What kinds of exercises will I do?\n\nNo clich√©d icebreakers here! Our exercises are all about authentic human connection, not cheesy romance. We're talking engaging dialogue, light partner yoga, movement/dance, heartwarming eye-gazing, and even some gentle hand-holding. It's a delightful mix that goes beyond the mundane 'what's your job' chatter.\n\nThe coolest part? Every exercise is wrapped around a positive relating skill. So, not only will you have a blast, you'll be building real relationship skills too! And remember consent, you're the boss of how you participate. It's all about fun and connection in a way that feels good for you.\n\n### What if one of the exercises is not my cup of tea?\n\nThanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify, or completely opt out. Everyone is encouraged to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators do a fabulous job demonstrating what that looks like, so it feels good for everyone.\n\n### So how does this all add up to dating?\n\nGreat question! Think of it as a refreshing twist on the traditional dating scene. You'll get to interact, laugh, and connect with others, and then decide who you'd like to get to know better. We put a fun spin on things by letting the ladies take the lead in choosing; they'll place one of their beads in each man's pouch that they want to connect with. They'll get a feel for the guys' personalities and presence, while the men are guided on how to be grounded and open-hearted. Afterwards, either party can contact the other. It's all about letting connections unfold naturally.\n\n### What is the schedule?\n\n*   **Doors Open**: Right at the start time, we'll check you in, hand over your dating materials, and give you a playing card for a super fun Ice Breaker game. You've got until the stations begin to mix and mingle!\n*   **20 minutes in**: Time to let in folks from the waiting list, making sure everything's balanced and ready to roll.\n*   **30 minutes in**: Ice Breaker game wraps up, and the doors close. Now the real fun begins as we kick off the event. Be sure to check in before this time, or you'll miss out on all the excitement! (Running late or need to cancel? Check our policy below.)\n*   **End of the Night**: You'll feel the warm glow of connection and may not want it to end. While we'll gently nudge you toward the door, it's common for guests to join together for dinner, continuing the connections and conversations. Who knows? Your night might just be getting started!\n\n### What should I wear?\n\nThink comfort with a touch of your best self! You'll be sitting and also moving, so choose an outfit that lets you feel relaxed but still sharp. Just remember, it's a date, so grooming matters. And go easy on strong scents; some people are sensitive.\n\n### Is there food or drink at the event?\n\nWe usually don't serve food or drinks (unless it's a special event), so feel free to bring a water bottle. Snacks might be good for before or after, but check with the venue, as some don't allow food. As tempting as a quick bite during the event might be, you'll want all your attention on your dates. And remember, alcohol is a no-go, so please arrive with a clear and ready mind.\n\n### How many dates will I have?\n\nGet ready for a lively evening with up to 20 opportunities to connect! Our events typically max out at around 40 singles. Assuming a balanced mix, you'll have the chance to spark a connection with up to 20 different people. And, we're all about quality not quantity. You'll find each moment meaningful as you dive into engaging exchanges with others who, just like you, are looking to explore connection and authenticity.\n\n### What is the gender balance at the event?\n\nWe don't believe in leaving anyone out of the fun, so we do our best to aim for an equal gender balance. Of course, it isn't always 100% under our control--even our matchmaking powers have their limits. But so far, just about every event has been sold out. And since we have an equal number of tickets per gender, they've all had a solid mix of singles ready to mingle! (We also occasionally use door sales magic to balance the gender too.)\n\n### What if I don't match with anyone?\n\nAs many of our attendees say, \"I don't even care if I match with anyone, this was amazing!\" That said, we geek out on data. Our statistics say there is a 94.09% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if for whatever reason the probability fails you, we've got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!\n\n### What is the age range?\n\nSome events have a suggested age range (noted in the title and description) and some are open to all ages. Whether you're a little outside the range or just curious about meeting people within it, you're welcome here.\n\nOur most popular events are open to all ages, drawing a vibrant and diverse crowd. Singles 30-45 tend to be the largest group. Followed by folks 45+ and then 20s. And while age might be a curiosity, what truly sets our events apart is the connection experience.\n\nBut here's the thing. It's more than just about the dates. And this is what makes Tantra Speed Date¬Æ unique. Singles everywhere rave about how the experience itself can be quite transformative, regardless of their matches. Why? Simply engaging consciously with other singles in a positive and structured way promotes more healthy relationships. And it just plain feels good to connect with real people. You likely have never experienced dating in such a fun and comfortable way. You'll gain confidence, pick up new skills, and will likely start to attract more quality people into your life. That's what our participants say over and over again!\n\n### Will there be enough people?\n\nDon't let low RSVPs in one spot fool you. Our events often sell out faster than you can say \"Namaste,\" and often with a waiting list. We're keen to promote across various platforms, and they don't all show the same love. Rest assured, we make sure there's always a crowd worth your while. So come on down; your next amazing connection could be just one RSVP away!\n\n### Do I have to be single to attend?\n\nAh, the modern relationship landscape‚Äîa tapestry of statuses! While you don't need to be 'single' in the traditional sense, you do need to be in a space where romantic connections are possible. If you're already committed and not open to new love, you may want to consider our couples events. But if you find your heart's door ajar, even just a smidge‚Äîor if you're teetering on the edge of 'ready to date'‚Äîthis could be the perfect space to explore what's possible. Consider this your invitation to a playground of connection, perfect for testing the waters!\n\n### Is this a heterosexual event and is there a Queer/LGBTQ Tantra Speed Date?\n\nDiversity is the spice of life, and we're cooking up all kinds of flavors! This classic version of Tantra Speed Date¬Æ is primarily designed for men-seeking-women and women-seeking-men. In this setup you'll find yourself in one of two gendered circles‚Äîone for men and one for women. You'll rotate through up to 20 dates with members of the opposite gender. But don't fret, fabulous queer friends! We also host Queer Tantra Speed Date events in select cities. So if you're looking for a rainbow connection, keep an eye on our website to see when we're bringing that magic to a city near you!\n\n### What is your cancellation/refund policy?\n\nWe get it‚Äîlife's a whirlwind! If you find yourself having to back out, no worries. Here's the lowdown: cancel 24 hours or more ahead and you'll get a refund or transfer, no fuss. If you're within that 24-hour window, or fashionably late and miss the opening ceremony, shoot us an email and we'll graciously \"speed date\" your ticket to the next event as a one-time courtesy. So keep your plans as flexible as a yoga pose, and communicate with us before the event kicks off. No refunds or transfers after the chimes ring and the magic starts!\n\n### Can I sign up with my friend?\n\nAbsolutely! We often have Bring-A-Friend ticket discounts! So thanks for sharing Tantra Speed Date¬Æ with your friends! However, do be sure to fill out their name and their email address on the attendee form. Otherwise we will not be able to check them in properly, and they will not receive all the wonderful matches they'll make at the event. If we had a nickel for how many times your friends email us wondering where their matches went... well, you get the picture. So please. Do your friends a solid and fill in their proper details.\n\n### More Questions?\n\nContact us at **help@tantrany.com** we'll be happy to tell you more about this event or others.",

Whether you're a beginner or intermediate, this four-week series will help you build confidence in your skills and open up new possibilities for your play.

    "description": "Learn the difference between breath, blood, and fantasy chokes and how to best play with each from a harm reduction lens\n\n**Choking education and knowledge is not only for those administering the chokes.**\n\nFor those receiving, you have an opportunity to learn what types of chokes are out there and what sensation you enjoy--or not! Learn the three types of chokes, risks, safety and how to engage in each of them during play.\n\nThere is more to negotiating choking than saying ‚Äòokay we‚Äôre both going to choke each other.' Especially when dealing with something that has such a wide range from a light fantasy choke to someone passing out. You may not know what type of choking you or your partners are into and that's okay! The neck is a very sensitive and delicate area. Even so much as resting your hand on your neck can feel invasive, let alone someone else‚Äôs.\n\n**What to expect:**\n\nThe first part of the class will be a discussion of safety followed by alternating demonstration and exercises/activities.\n\n**Who should attend:**\n\nThis class is open to people of all skill and experience levels. Come with a partner or solo. Many of the movements can be practiced on yourself, and for those looking to practice with someone there will be a way to do that (although being able to practice with someone you don't know is not guaranteed).\n\n**About the Instructor:**\n\nLola Jean is a sex educator, fetish wrestler, and world record holder for volume squirting.

    "description": "#### Workshop: CARE-FULL: **Week Four: When Things Go Wrong**\n\nKink is inherently risky and there‚Äôs no way around it. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are a beginner or a seasoned kink veteran - the unexpected _will_ occur. In those moments, the integrity of our systems is put to the test.¬†\n\nSafety is not the absence of incidents or accidents; it‚Äôs the presence of barriers and defenses against them.

Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards.

We ignore the countless nerve endings in our scrotum and testicles and thus deny ourselves a plethora of pleasurable possibilities. In this workshop, we'll stretch, tug, tickle, suck, and knead our way into a world of tantalizing testicular titillation. Nexus will lead you through self-touch exercises, then he'll arrange you into rotating pairs to share in mutual ball pleasuring. We'll end with a free-play session to play and experiment with our new appreciation for testicular sensation. Let's suit up (or down) and play ball!\n\n**What to expect at the class:**\n\nThe class is touch inspired and is 2 hrs long to give everyone a chance to experience thingsin a comfortable way and plenty of time for long fun.\n\n**Desired Benefits**\n\n*   Experience new levels of pleasure from the balls and scrotum\n*   Get creative and experimental with how we're touching these parts\n\n**Who is welcome**\n\nThis is a body-positive workshop for folks of all shapes, colors, sizes, experience, and ages 21+. It centers cis and trans men seeking connection through touch, while embracing nonbinary siblings who connect with male-centered spaces.

Look no further than Geekaholic, the ultimate destination for connoisseurs of kink, geeks, nerds, and newcomers to the vibrant NYC scene!\n\n‚Äî\n\n### THINGS TO KNOW:\n\n*   This is a munch, meaning no sex acts will be allowed at this event, and kink is only allowed in the classroom area upstairs during relevant workshops/highlights. However, discussion is allowed and encouraged anywhere during the event! This is a social gathering to meet fellow geeks and kinksters and enjoy a fun evening of games and conversation. Full rules can be found [here](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/rules).\n*   As always, this event is open to anyone and everyone to attend. We aim to create a safe space for members of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community and other marginalized groups. If anyone ever makes you feel unsafe at our events, please reach out to our staff.\n*   Our events are at a _dedicated_ venue at Prime Produce Co-op and are graciously hosted by PLAN Gaming ([https://www.plangaming.org/](https://www.plangaming.org/)), which is a non-profit incubator. All people present in the space will specifically be there for this event, so we can talk openly about kink and related topics.\n*   At Geekaholic, we believe in making our events accessible to everyone, so Geekaholic Munches operate on a \"Pay What You Can\" model. While we suggest a donation of $20, every contribution helps us sustain our partnership with Prime Produce and helps enrich our own future event programming.\n*   The space houses 90 games in its library and counting (see the full list on our [discord](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/discord)). But also, feel free to bring your own games! All board game skill levels, from newbie onward, are welcome!\n*   Our venue has a dedicated caf√© on premises, but everyone is welcome to bring their own food/drinks as well. See the related section below for more info on our special menu offerings!\n*   We usually play board games for about five hours and then go for drinks at a nearby bar. Everyone (21+) is welcome for both!\n*   Most of attendees RSVP on fetlife. And we average at least 50 in person attendees. Feel free to RSVP there as well if you have an account, but an account is not required to attend our events. Fetlife event link: [https://fetlife.com/events/1562008](https://fetlife.com/events/1562008)\n\n‚Äî\n\n### ‚ú® **_August Highlights_**‚ú®\n\nTBA\n\n‚Äî\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):**\n\nüìç **Am I at the right place?**\n\n_The building is unmarked since it's an event space and food co-op office normally (because hey, New York). Come into 424 West 54th Street and find our signup desk right at the entrance._\n\nüé≠ **What is a Munch?**\n\n_A BDSM munch is a friendly, social gathering of people interested in BDSM or kink. It is a good event for newcomers, providing a safe space to learn, socialize and establish a rapport within the kink community. There is no nudity or sex, just fellow kinksters talking (and playing games!) - feel free to dress comfortably. We focus on creating a welcoming environment for everyone!_\n\nüò®¬†**I‚Äôm feeling nervous! I‚Äôve never been to something like this.**\n\n_Don't_ h_esitate to get in touch with us and let us know!

If you have any questions about the event, send us a DM!_\n\nüçî **Can we bring our own food, drinks, and/or beer?**\n\n_Yes! Even though we have a cafe on premises, you are welcome to bring anything to eat and drink._\n\n‚öì **What is ‚ÄúCruising‚Äù and why is it prohibited at our events?**\n\n‚Äú_Cruising‚Äù involves either mass messaging attendees or attending events solely with the intent of soliciting casual sex or advertising other events and not seeking meaningful connections. In a BDSM munch, this goes against the respectful, consensual nature. Munches prioritize building connections, fostering community, and open conversations, not pursuing purely sexual encounters._\n\nüìÖ **How can I stay up to date with upcoming events?**\n\n_Stay connected and be the first to know about our monthly Tabletop RPG sessions, munches, road trips, parties, and more by joining our FetLife group_ [_here_](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/fetlife-group)\n\nüìû **Is there a way to stay in touch with everyone I meet?**\n\n_Absolutely! Connect with your friends and fellow attendees through our Geekaholic Discord server_ [_here_](https://go.geekaholic.nyc/discord)\n\nüí® **Is Marijuana/Vaping allowed?**\n\n_Feel free to step outside to smoke. Smoking indoors is prohibited, so please be considerate of those who may not partake._\n\nüîû **Will I need to be over 21 to attend?**\n\n_No. You can attend as long as you're over 18. However, for the purchase/consumption of alcoholic beverages, you must present valid photo identification showing you are 21 or older to comply with NY state laws._\n\nüì£¬†**How do I get involved or support the Geekaholic community?**\n\n_Thank you for asking!

Relive the thrill of your school days with a naughty twist. Get ready to embrace the energy of classroom crushes, mischievous pranks, and after-school delights. Dance to the beats of your favorite school anthems while exploring themed areas that bring out your inner teacher's pet or rebellious student. Whether you're rocking a classic uniform or channeling your favorite school character, this night is all about reliving the excitement of the first day back. Sharpen your pencils, grab your hall pass, and get ready for a night of fun, flirtation, and kink at the ultimate \"Back to School\" party!\n\n(Any questions, more info/details and community guidelines please see [PagansParadise.com](https://pagansparadise.com/))\n\nWelcome to a mesmerizing evening at Sapphic Sirens, where we celebrate the splendor of sapphic connections. This event is a haven for women, trans, and non-binary/GNC individuals to enjoy camaraderie, community, pleasure, and playful moments. We encourage you to dress like the goddesses you are and prepare for a night of indulgence. We‚Äôre committed to creating a safe and welcoming space to facilitate new relationships, exploration, and fulfillment of desires! Good vibes only ‚Äî or else! ;)\n\n### Who Can Attend\n\nSAPPHICS (21+). If you do not fit the below definition, please do not come. This is meant to be an intentional space for sapphics to meet other sapphics. For everyone else, there are other Pagans Paradise events that you‚Äôll love. Obviously, enforcing this policy is tricky, but we will trust attendees to respect our space and our intentions.\n\n> (Definition from [LGBTQIA+ Wiki](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Sapphic)) Sapphic, sometimes known as women loving women (WLW),or sapphist, refers to a woman or woman-aligned person of any sexual orientation who is attracted to women or woman aligned genders/gender identities. We mean to be specifically inclusive of non-binary people. It is an umbrella term for many identities, including those who are lesbian, pansexual, bisexual, or queer. It is used to promote solidarity among women and non-binary people of all identities who are attracted to those who are women and woman-aligned. It may also be used as an identity, and may be found particularly useful for individuals who know they are attracted to women but may be uncertain if they are attracted to other genders. It can also be used to describe a relationship between two women.\n\n**Ultimately, we reserve the right to remove anyone, sapphic or not, for any reason** - this is usually a last resort consequence of a breach of our Community Guidelines. Please respect this privileged space and treat it as your own home.\n\n### The Night will feature:\n\n*   Orientation: Nix, our host, will review guidelines about consent & mutual desire to ensure we‚Äôre all on the same page and will respect this privileged safe space. We‚Äôll also explain the different rooms, play stations, and group activities throughout the night.\n*   Icebreakers: To facilitate new friendships and manifest fantasies, attendees will give a brief introduction including name, pronouns, and speak out loud any desires for the night. Note - this does not guarantee that your dreams will come true - and we discourage transactional Desperate D\\*ck/Predatory P\\*ssy energy! ‚Ä¶ but wishing out loud increases the chances of magic happening!\n*   A spectacular performance by burlesque queen Rita-n-Wink! (showering her with love in the form of dollar bills highly appreciated and encouraged)\n*   A wide variety of goodies sold by [Pretty Tokers](https://www.instagram.com/prettytokers.official)!¬†\n*   SAPPHIC Room: sensual & light, for massage, oils, etc.\n*   SIREN Room: kinky & dark, impact, rope, etc.\n*   Bracelet system: back by popular demand, our bracelet system can help match you to folks with compatible interests.

    "description": "Downtown Brooklyn Polyamory is back with another picnic in the park! Join us as we welcome our local non-monogamous, polyamorous, and curious folks for conversation and connection.\n\nAs usual, expect to chat about how to be our best poly/non-monogamous selves. This event is outdoors, and will mostly be about free mingling and chatting. Whether you are a long-time group member eager to reconnect with old friends, or a first-timer looking to learn more about polyamory and non-monogamy and meet like-minded people, come join us!\n\n**First-time attendees, please see one of the organizers when you arrive to get a welcome, a name-tag, and to be introduced to the group.** Organizers can be identified by the stars (badly) drawn on the four corners of their name-tags.\n\nWeather permitting, we will be in Brooklyn Bridge Park in the green space just South of Pier 1 (Bridge View Lawn) from 2:30pm - 5:00pm, but feel free to stay longer. This location is a grassy field with both shade and sun. It is always wise to bring something like a blanket, towel or little tarp to sit on in case the ground is wet. Feel free to bring snacks or drinks to share, but coming empty-handed is also totally fine. In case of heavy rain, we may reschedule at the last minute, but we usually proceed if there is only a drizzle or a short shower.\n\nThis meetup is about connecting with old and new friends and sharing ideas and experiences. It is not a cruising or pickup event, so please do not come with those expectations or intentions as they can make folks uncomfortable and feel unsafe. As always, be sure to get permission before getting close to or touching any other participant. Help us keep this a safe and supportive space!\n\nOur group values ethics, inclusion, growth and compassion as a means to support each of our unique journeys in developing non-traditional relationships. Please be prepared to bring those values, along with an awareness of the fundamental importance of consent and a respect for all others if you attend our events. We look forward to welcoming everyone interested or curious about non-monogamy and polyamory. :)\n\nSee you in the park!\n\nMarco, Faun, & Clara",

Basic Knots (Sep 9)\n2.  Restriction (Sep 16)\n3.  Torture Ties(Sep 23)\n4.  Rope Art (Sep 30)\n\n**_Address given in confirmation email additional info, this location is a walkup._**\n\nPagans Paradise Production Facilitated by Rob\n\n**_We are having a 2-part evening of indulgence and learning. Come for the workshop and stay for the Jam to practice what you learned and meet other like-minded folks!_**\n\nIn **ROPE WITH ROB**, we focus on strengthening your fundamentals, giving you the foundation to explore the versatility of rope. Whether you're a beginner or intermediate, this four-week series will help you build confidence in your skills and open up new possibilities for your play. Rope is more than just a tool‚Äîit's a medium for creating art, exploring intimacy, embracing peace, or pushing boundaries through sensation and control.\n\nAs we progress through each workshop, you'll discover how the fundamentals of rope can be adapted to suit a wide range of styles, from the decorative to the intense. Come ready to learn, tie, and experiment in a supportive environment.\n\n**WEEK TWO: Restriction (Sep 16)**\n\n*   **Rope as a Tool of Restriction**: Learn how to use rope to immobilize your partner in ways that enhance power dynamics and vulnerability.\n*   **Safe Boundaries**: Explore safety considerations, including circulation and nerve risks, while experimenting with tighter, more restrictive ties.\n*   **Different Levels of Restriction**: Understand how to modulate between light restriction and full immobilization, based on your partner's comfort and your goals.\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback.¬†\n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios.¬†\n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all gender identifications, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event.¬†\n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm. Please be on time and text ahead if you are delayed.¬†\n*   You are welcome to wear a mask throughout the duration of the event.\n*   We encourage all to engage chat via Plura before/after the event!\n\n#### Jam After the Workshop:\n\nStick around for our jam session, exclusively open to workshop participants. During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Rob will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n‚óè **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n‚óè **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\nSAVE WHEN YOU GO TO ALL FOUR: Workshops $140 or Workshop + Jams $260\n\n_Required Disclaimer: It should go without saying, but we are going to spell it out clearly nonetheless: kink activities are inherently risky and safety is something that requires practice and cannot be guaranteed. By attending, you agree to participate at your own risk, conduct your own risk management, and agree to hold the event facilitators and facility harmless for any type of harm that may occur._\n\nAny questions or concerns email PagansParadiseNYC@gmail.com\n\nPagansParadise.com IG: @pagansparadise",

Come for the workshop and stay for the Jam to practice what you learned and meet other like-minded folks!_**\n\nDelve into new pathways towards resilience and self-discovery with alternative modalities of trauma healing.\n\nA seminar delving into how trauma affects the body and brain, how kink impacts the brain, and when and how kink can be used as a healing modality for trauma.\n\nDuring Q&A, participants will get a chance to talk about their own experiences and get ideas on how they could incorporate healing elements into their scenes and dynamics. You will be able to explore your own experiences and plan scenes to address them. Everyone is welcome to also share their ideas to creatively brainstorm.\n\n**Desired Benefits**\n\nMany people have a misunderstanding of trauma and kink, and the stigma associated can make it hard to find resources on how to tell if you‚Äôre playing safely (emotionally speaking). This workshop will give you a base level understanding of how trauma healing works, and how kink can parallel and accentuate this healing.\n\nYou will also learn when NOT to use kink to heal your trauma, and what steps you can take with partners to make sure that they‚Äôre supported through their trauma play.\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Communication Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and interactive discussions. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback.\n*   **Solo and Group Work**: : You can come alone or with a partner. During the communication exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup scene scenarios. Opt in experience, only do what is comfortable for you.\n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: : Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to jam for those staying. Expect to possibly interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication. More physical practice will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow.

    "description": "Does the thought of getting frisky in public excite you? Learn covert and overt ways to play when you're out and about. All welcome.\n\nDoes the thought of getting frisky in public excite you?\n\n\"Playing in Public\" means any type of play (doesn't have to be explicitly s\\*xual) that's in public. Yes, there's a possibility of someone seeing you BUT being discovered/seen may or may not be your intent. Public play can also be with a partner(s) or on your own. Let's explore the possibilities and ways of playing in public in new and exciting ways!\n\n**In this class, you will learn**\n\n\\- how to unleash your inner exhibitionist\n\n\\- how to improve your or your partner's comfort if you/they are a non-exhibitionist (AKA covert play)\n\n\\- how to improve your own or your partner's comfort in public\n\n\\- tips for how to play overtly or covertly in public (no one has to be the wiser!)\n\n\\- tips for location ideas, from beginner to more advanced\n\n\\- tips for personal play in public and/or playing with another/others\n\n\\- tips for dressing/undressing quickly\n\n\\- suggestions for toys and other helpful play tools\n\n\\- tips for edging, games, and \"tasks\"\n\n\\- how to keep leveling up your public s\\*xploration, if that's your goal\n\n\\- how to pinpoint your strongest org@sm triggers so you can get your freak on faster, easier, and anywhere\n\n\\- how be safer and more prudent (AKA how to avoid getting caught!)\n\n**Level**\n\nThis class is for everyone! Exhibitionists and non-exhibitionists alike will find plenty of ideas for how to play in public to their level of comfort and excitement.\n\n**Format**\n\nThis is an organized class that incorporates visuals (PowerPoint and demonstrations), explanations and class participation. Demonstrations will include ways to covertly and overtly play in public including ways to dress & items to carry to optimize for covert/overt play, ideas for things to wear beneath your clothes, toys to incorporate, and more.\n\n**Who should attend**\n\nAll gender identities and relationship types (singles, solo poly, couples, polycules, and more) are welcome. Many ideas were created for myself early in my k!nk exploration when I, as a non-exhibitionist, was trying to find ways to play with and be comfortable with exhibitionist play partners in front of an audience.\n\n**What to bring**\n\nPlease bring a notebook and a pen/pencil to take notes. There will be a rope demo- feel free to bring 10-20ft of 1/4\"-1\" diameter rope if you'd like to follow along with a rope demo (nylon and cotton rope is super cheap, available online and will work well). I will also share a video after the class of this demo.\n\n**What to wear**\n\nI encourage everyone to wear what makes them feel good. I'll be dressing/undressing and demonstrating ways to use toys as well as other things that you and/or your partner may like.\n\n**About Your Instructor**\n\n[Knotasha](https://www.instagram.com/knotashanyc/) (she/her) is a s\\*x educator and fet!sh model who has been actively in the k\\*nk scene for a decade. For over 8 years, she has taught and co-taught at venues and k\\*nky conventions such as HitMeUp Academy, K\\*nk dot com, Soho House, Westcoast Bound, KinkFest, Thunder in the Mountains, and DomCon.

    "description": "**Lunar Acroyoga Flow for Couples: Clothing Optional 7pm-10pm**\n\n**_Address given in confirmation email additional info_**\n\n_Note: We keep with Eventbrite guidelines. This an educational workshop and experience with both theory and practical elements as explained in details below. Non Sexual Class._\n\n**Facilitated by** [Thomas](https://www.learninglab.fans/acroyoga)\n\n**Join us for an intimate and transformative journey into the serene world of Lunar Acroyoga, where trust, connection, and healing intertwine in a beautiful dance.**\n\nSchedule\n--------\n\nWe‚Äôll move the evening through three distinct phases:\n\n1.  **High-energy workout:** After an opening circle, we‚Äôll develop foundational skills for acroyoga. We‚Äôll begin with partner exercises, technique lessons, and move on to basic acroyoga poses. This will be an energetic workout in groups of three: A base (person on the ground), a flyer (person in the air), and a spotter (for safety). You‚Äôll get to make new friends and interact with the group. (This part is clothed.)\n2.  **Calming Massage:** You‚Äôll settle with your partner into your own space. You have the option of taking off as much clothing as you enjoy. We‚Äôll learn massage techniques that we‚Äôll later apply in the air. For example, you may be used to ‚Äúpushing‚Äù your hand onto the recipient‚Äôs body. We‚Äôll learn how to lower the recipient‚Äôs body onto your hand. We‚Äôll learn to develop the quality of touch with the sandbag exercise.\n3.  **Magic Lunar Time:** We‚Äôll demonstrate a lunar acroyoga flow. You‚Äôll copy us as we go along. One partner will be on the ground. The other will be in the air getting guided through a sequence of stretches and massages. Being upside down decompresses the spine and lets one deeply surrender. We‚Äôll repeat the flow 2-3 times to switch receiving/giving.\n\nPractical note: Expect that for safety reasons, you‚Äôll have to have a spotter. So you‚Äôll want to make friends early in the class with another couple to trade spotting for the lunar acro flows in the last hour.\n\nBenefits\n--------\n\n*   **Trust:** You‚Äôll quickly realize that there is a lot of trust involved in holding someone in the air or being held in the air. Couples can face challenges on how to assure their partner and how to build trust in small steps.\n*   **Communication:** In everyday life, it‚Äôs all too easy to be quiet or become comfortable with convenient misunderstandings. Acroyoga requires you to speak up and communicate clearly because the result (a crash or success) is very direct. Practitioners develop clear and direct communication.\n*   **Great workout:** Acroyoga is a great full-body workout that pushes you to your max because you want to achieve the next pose with your partner. Active flexibility is developed - being able to develop power in stretched positions.\n*   **A great skill to take anywhere:** Once you‚Äôve learned a few acro moves, it‚Äôs a great skill that you can take anywhere: home, to the park, to the beach, on vacation, to show your friends, etc.\n*   **Intimacy:** You‚Äôll spend an evening being close with your partner, engaging in intimate couple activities. It‚Äôll bring you pleasure and fond memories.\n\nWho Is This For?\n----------------\n\nAcroyoga is a very physical activity, involves touching other people, and is quite playful/adventurous. People who like that kind of thing usually know that they are drawn to acroyoga. Quite a few people are drawn to it but are worried about physical fitness. It‚Äôs a lot more accessible than you probably think because we use technique instead of raw muscle strength to hold people up. If you can hold the top of a push-up, you are probably good to go.\n\nThe workshop is aimed at couples to make the clothing optional part of the workshop comfortable. If you have a good friend with whom you are comfortable, join us!\n\nAlso if you come as a trio, it‚Äôll make it easier because acro typically involves three people: A base, flyer, and spotter.\n\nAcroyoga\n--------\n\nAcroyoga is a sport that usually involves a trio: The base (person on the ground), the flyer (person in the air), and the spotter (safety person). The base lifts the flyer into the air. The two move through a sequence of poses - often a washing machine (so named because it ends with the same pose that it starts with and can be repeated). The practice is split into solar and lunar acroyoga. Solar acroyoga is circus-like, challenging, hard, and exciting. Lunar acroyoga is calming, relaxing, and therapeutic. It often involves holding comfortable poses, stretches, massage, and Thai yoga.\n\nFitness Requirement\n-------------------\n\nI‚Äôve been teaching acroyoga to hundreds of students. A common worry is that curious people aren‚Äôt sure if they are fit enough. Most people are because we use technique rather than muscle strength. However, occasionally people have shown up who are very out of shape. As a rule of thumb, you should be able to hold a top of a push-up (plank pose) easily.\n\nBeginning guys tend to have hamstring flexibility challenges. This can be helped by putting a bolster or rolled-up yoga mat under the hips.\n\nSafety\n------\n\nThere is no absolute safety. Even familiar sports like soccer come with leg fractures and concussions from two people running into each other. Yet that‚Äôs not the typical day-to-day experience. We‚Äôll have a safety briefing for important safety rules. We‚Äôll do beginner-friendly activities. We‚Äôll use spotters - a person who will guide the flyer to the ground in case of a fall. There will be a release of liability waiver to sign, which is standard for physical activity.\n\nClothing Optional\n-----------------\n\nThe first hour will be a group activity and clothed. Once you move into your couple‚Äôs space, you can take off as much or as little as you are comfortable. For the clothing optional, consider the feeling of freedom when dancing across a wildflower meadow in the Alps.\n\nWhat To Bring\n-------------\n\n*   Water to hydrate\n*   A snack because it‚Äôs a three-hour workshop\n*   A towel to put over the yoga mat.\n*   (Optional) your own yoga mat\n\nThe Instructors\n---------------\n\nLisa and Thomas have over ten years of acro experience between them and taught hundreds of students. Thomas is the organized master planner. Lisa brings the joy and play. Their dynamic complement will delight you through the evening.\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/acroyogalabnyc](https://www.instagram.com/acroyogalabnyc?igsh=N2Z3dW4zN2RncXdi)\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/thomasfischersm/](https://www.instagram.com/thomasfischersm/)\n\n**Workshop Paired Tickets (Good for 2): Early Bird $90, Regular $120, $150 at the door**\n\n**Workshop Trio Tickets (Good for 3): $150**\n\nNOTE: We encourage everyone to have an open mind as this is a fun, open and explorative learning environment. We practice and review informed & ongoing consent practices with an emphasis on mutual opt in desire.

You might just want to observe (observing is a valid form of participation), or you might want to share light touch and cuddling or healing massage. You get to decide what you want to do, and you do not have to do anything you are uncomfortable with. You do not have to touch or interact with anyone unless you want to. All activities must be safe, sane and consensual, and within the boundaries we have set.\n\nWe adhere to common community guidelines and do not allow inappropriate behavior.\n\nWho Should Attend?\n\nAll persons 21 or older regardless of orientation, race, ability or religion. If you are open-minded and interested in sharing loving touch, we welcome you. If you are just curious but don‚Äôt want to play, you are welcome to come experience the atmosphere. Nobody will touch you without your verbal consent.\n\nWe expect everyone who attends to be able to abide by our guidelines and respect boundaries. Attendees should be able to communicate clearly with others and know their own limitations. We expect a level of emotional maturity and spiritual awareness that will allow you to function in a group setting.\n\nWhat to Wear\n\nDress in something comfortable! You will want to wear something you can easily move around in. Shoes will be left at the door.\n\nPlease do not use any scented products or perfumes before coming to the party to respect those with sensitivities to fragrance.\n\nWhat to Bring\n\nWe will have an area set aside for your belongings. Bring a water bottle (only closed-lid bottles containing water will be allowed in the play areas).\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nThis will be a relaxed, playful event. We will have an opening circle where we establish our container for the evening. We will review guidelines and discuss boundaries, followed by a brief ice-breaker activity. After that you will be free to explore on your own. Facilitators will be available to help guide your spiritual practices and ensure everyone stays within the boundaries we have set.\n\nExpect to have a fun evening and connect with some like-minded individuals. You get to decide how to participate. This is a safe space where participants are encouraged to explore themselves and others in ways that are spiritual, healthy, stimulating, nurturing, exciting, safe, consensual and fun!",

Check out the [FAQ on our website](https://tantrany.com/speed-dating/?aff=4ebfaq) (bottom of page)!\n\n### What is Tantra, and why \"Tantra\" Speed Date?\n\nForget those wild myths and blockbuster misunderstandings; Tantra is more about connection, fun, and being present than anything risqu√©. Imagine it as the art of \"relationship yoga,\" blending age-old practices with a twist of joy and mindfulness. Through exercises like breathing, meditating, and maybe even a little dancing, you'll find yourself more in tune with those around you. It's like a social superpower for making genuine connections, and trust us, it's a blast! After all, we find this level of presence is exactly what's missing from most dating encounters today. Why just talk when you can laugh, connect, and explore together?\n\n### What does this style of dating look like?\n\nPicture this: You'll form two fun-filled circles of fellow daters. The men make up the outer ring, and the women form the inner ring; so that you're paired off with a friendly face across from you. Together, you'll dive into engaging and heartfelt mini-dates (we call them 'dating stations') that last just long enough to spark a connection. After each experience, you'll bring your hands into a cheerful 'Namaste', share a quick thank you, and then ‚Äî whoosh! ‚Äî off to the next exciting meeting. Keep circling around, and by the end, you'll have met everyone.\n\n### What kinds of exercises will I do?\n\nNo clich√©d icebreakers here! Our exercises are all about authentic human connection, not cheesy romance. We're talking engaging dialogue, light partner yoga, movement/dance, heartwarming eye-gazing, and even some gentle hand-holding. It's a delightful mix that goes beyond the mundane 'what's your job' chatter.\n\nThe coolest part? Every exercise is wrapped around a positive relating skill. So, not only will you have a blast, you'll be building real relationship skills too! And remember consent, you're the boss of how you participate. It's all about fun and connection in a way that feels good for you.\n\n### What if one of the exercises is not my cup of tea?\n\nThanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify, or completely opt out. Everyone is encouraged to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators do a fabulous job demonstrating what that looks like, so it feels good for everyone.\n\n### So how does this all add up to dating?\n\nGreat question! Think of it as a refreshing twist on the traditional dating scene. You'll get to interact, laugh, and connect with others, and then decide who you'd like to get to know better. We put a fun spin on things by letting the ladies take the lead in choosing; they'll place one of their beads in each man's pouch that they want to connect with. They'll get a feel for the guys' personalities and presence, while the men are guided on how to be grounded and open-hearted. Afterwards, either party can contact the other. It's all about letting connections unfold naturally.\n\n### What is the schedule?\n\n*   **Doors Open**: Right at the start time, we'll check you in, hand over your dating materials, and give you a playing card for a super fun Ice Breaker game. You've got until the stations begin to mix and mingle!\n*   **20 minutes in**: Time to let in folks from the waiting list, making sure everything's balanced and ready to roll.\n*   **30 minutes in**: Ice Breaker game wraps up, and the doors close. Now the real fun begins as we kick off the event. Be sure to check in before this time, or you'll miss out on all the excitement! (Running late or need to cancel? Check our policy below.)\n*   **End of the Night**: You'll feel the warm glow of connection and may not want it to end. While we'll gently nudge you toward the door, it's common for guests to join together for dinner, continuing the connections and conversations. Who knows? Your night might just be getting started!\n\n### What should I wear?\n\nThink comfort with a touch of your best self! You'll be sitting and also moving, so choose an outfit that lets you feel relaxed but still sharp. Just remember, it's a date, so grooming matters. And go easy on strong scents; some people are sensitive.\n\n### Is there food or drink at the event?\n\nWe usually don't serve food or drinks (unless it's a special event), so feel free to bring a water bottle. Snacks might be good for before or after, but check with the venue, as some don't allow food. As tempting as a quick bite during the event might be, you'll want all your attention on your dates. And remember, alcohol is a no-go, so please arrive with a clear and ready mind.\n\n### How many dates will I have?\n\nGet ready for a lively evening with up to 20 opportunities to connect! Our events typically max out at around 40 singles. Assuming a balanced mix, you'll have the chance to spark a connection with up to 20 different people. And, we're all about quality not quantity. You'll find each moment meaningful as you dive into engaging exchanges with others who, just like you, are looking to explore connection and authenticity.\n\n### What is the gender balance at the event?\n\nWe don't believe in leaving anyone out of the fun, so we do our best to aim for an equal gender balance. Of course, it isn't always 100% under our control--even our matchmaking powers have their limits. But so far, just about every event has been sold out. And since we have an equal number of tickets per gender, they've all had a solid mix of singles ready to mingle! (We also occasionally use door sales magic to balance the gender too.)\n\n### What if I don't match with anyone?\n\nAs many of our attendees say, \"I don't even care if I match with anyone, this was amazing!\" That said, we geek out on data. Our statistics say there is a 94.09% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if for whatever reason the probability fails you, we've got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!\n\n### What is the age range?\n\nSome events have a suggested age range (noted in the title and description) and some are open to all ages. Whether you're a little outside the range or just curious about meeting people within it, you're welcome here.\n\nOur most popular events are open to all ages, drawing a vibrant and diverse crowd. Singles 30-45 tend to be the largest group. Followed by folks 45+ and then 20s. And while age might be a curiosity, what truly sets our events apart is the connection experience.\n\nBut here's the thing. It's more than just about the dates. And this is what makes Tantra Speed Date¬Æ unique. Singles everywhere rave about how the experience itself can be quite transformative, regardless of their matches. Why? Simply engaging consciously with other singles in a positive and structured way promotes more healthy relationships. And it just plain feels good to connect with real people. You likely have never experienced dating in such a fun and comfortable way. You'll gain confidence, pick up new skills, and will likely start to attract more quality people into your life. That's what our participants say over and over again!\n\n### Will there be enough people?\n\nDon't let low RSVPs in one spot fool you. Our events often sell out faster than you can say \"Namaste,\" and often with a waiting list. We're keen to promote across various platforms, and they don't all show the same love. Rest assured, we make sure there's always a crowd worth your while. So come on down; your next amazing connection could be just one RSVP away!\n\n### Do I have to be single to attend?\n\nAh, the modern relationship landscape‚Äîa tapestry of statuses! While you don't need to be 'single' in the traditional sense, you do need to be in a space where romantic connections are possible. If you're already committed and not open to new love, you may want to consider our couples events. But if you find your heart's door ajar, even just a smidge‚Äîor if you're teetering on the edge of 'ready to date'‚Äîthis could be the perfect space to explore what's possible. Consider this your invitation to a playground of connection, perfect for testing the waters!\n\n### Is this a heterosexual event and is there a Queer/LGBTQ Tantra Speed Date?\n\nDiversity is the spice of life, and we're cooking up all kinds of flavors! This classic version of Tantra Speed Date¬Æ is primarily designed for men-seeking-women and women-seeking-men. In this setup you'll find yourself in one of two gendered circles‚Äîone for men and one for women. You'll rotate through up to 20 dates with members of the opposite gender. But don't fret, fabulous queer friends! We also host Queer Tantra Speed Date events in select cities. So if you're looking for a rainbow connection, keep an eye on our website to see when we're bringing that magic to a city near you!\n\n### What is your cancellation/refund policy?\n\nWe get it‚Äîlife's a whirlwind! If you find yourself having to back out, no worries. Here's the lowdown: cancel 24 hours or more ahead and you'll get a refund or transfer, no fuss. If you're within that 24-hour window, or fashionably late and miss the opening ceremony, shoot us an email and we'll graciously \"speed date\" your ticket to the next event as a one-time courtesy. So keep your plans as flexible as a yoga pose, and communicate with us before the event kicks off. No refunds or transfers after the chimes ring and the magic starts!\n\n### Can I sign up with my friend?\n\nAbsolutely! We often have Bring-A-Friend ticket discounts! So thanks for sharing Tantra Speed Date¬Æ with your friends! However, do be sure to fill out their name and their email address on the attendee form. Otherwise we will not be able to check them in properly, and they will not receive all the wonderful matches they'll make at the event. If we had a nickel for how many times your friends email us wondering where their matches went... well, you get the picture. So please. Do your friends a solid and fill in their proper details.\n\n### More Questions?\n\nContact us at **help@tantrany.com** we'll be happy to tell you more about this event or others.",

After that you will be free to explore on your own. Facilitators will be available to help guide your spiritual practices and ensure everyone stays within the boundaries we have set.\n\nExpect to have a fun evening and connect with some like-minded individuals. You get to decide how to participate. This is a safe space where participants are encouraged to explore themselves and others in ways that are spiritual, healthy, stimulating, nurturing, exciting, safe, consensual and fun!",

Whether you're draped in ethereal fabrics, adorned with nature-inspired accessories, or channeling the power of a dark sorceress, this evening is all about celebrating the magic of the nocturnal. Unleash your inner nymph or witch and let the night guide you through a world of sensual exploration and unforgettable encounters.\n\n(Any questions, more info/details and community guidelines please see [PagansParadise.com](https://pagansparadise.com/))\n\nWelcome to a mesmerizing evening at Sapphic Sirens, where we celebrate the splendor of sapphic connections.

We encourage you to dress like the goddesses you are and prepare for a night of indulgence. We‚Äôre committed to creating a safe and welcoming space to facilitate new relationships, exploration, and fulfillment of desires! Good vibes only ‚Äî or else! ;)\n\n### Who Can Attend\n\nSAPPHICS (21+). If you do not fit the below definition, please do not come. This is meant to be an intentional space for sapphics to meet other sapphics. For everyone else, there are other Pagans Paradise events that you‚Äôll love. Obviously, enforcing this policy is tricky, but we will trust attendees to respect our space and our intentions.\n\n> (Definition from [LGBTQIA+ Wiki](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Sapphic)) Sapphic, sometimes known as women loving women (WLW),or sapphist, refers to a woman or woman-aligned person of any sexual orientation who is attracted to women or woman aligned genders/gender identities. We mean to be specifically inclusive of non-binary people. It is an umbrella term for many identities, including those who are lesbian, pansexual, bisexual, or queer. It is used to promote solidarity among women and non-binary people of all identities who are attracted to those who are women and woman-aligned. It may also be used as an identity, and may be found particularly useful for individuals who know they are attracted to women but may be uncertain if they are attracted to other genders. It can also be used to describe a relationship between two women.\n\n**Ultimately, we reserve the right to remove anyone, sapphic or not, for any reason** - this is usually a last resort consequence of a breach of our Community Guidelines. Please respect this privileged space and treat it as your own home.\n\n### The Night will feature:\n\n*   Orientation: Nix, our host, will review guidelines about consent & mutual desire to ensure we‚Äôre all on the same page and will respect this privileged safe space. We‚Äôll also explain the different rooms, play stations, and group activities throughout the night.\n*   Icebreakers: To facilitate new friendships and manifest fantasies, attendees will give a brief introduction including name, pronouns, and speak out loud any desires for the night. Note - this does not guarantee that your dreams will come true - and we discourage transactional Desperate D\\*ck/Predatory P\\*ssy energy! ‚Ä¶ but wishing out loud increases the chances of magic happening!\n*   A spectacular performance by burlesque queen Rita-n-Wink!

A beautiful and sacred ancient ritual that has been practiced for thousands of years.\n\nIt is a beautiful ceremony of honoring and adoring the Divine that dwells within each of us, and brings us into a profound space of connection and universal Love.\n\nThis experience welcomes everyone, all faiths, and orientations.\n\nView the image gallery under the Discussion tab to get an idea what the experience will be like. (Pics and Videos from the last one)\n\nStep into a world of acceptance and sensation where all of you is welcome. Each person is invited into magical connections to expand your experience/capacity of giving and receiving. The ritual begins the moment you enter as you are celebrated, seen and adored for ALL you are.\n\nThis evening‚Äôs ceremony is dedicated to all genders. In fact, participants will not know whether they will be in the giving or receiving role until they arrive. We will use movement, sound and the five elements, all given to us with ample instruction, enriching each experience throughout the evening. You may find yourself turning inwards and becoming aware of abundant love and innate beauty that is part of your being.\n\nThis ceremony opens people's hearts in a way that allows them to see the inner beauty and the Divine within us all. The participants in the giving role will be instructed in performing an ancient ritual, which is simple in form yet very powerful in practice. As the participants in the receiving role accept the offerings and adoration, they in turn connect with unconditional love and reflect that adoration back to the givers with their presence. Taking part in these rituals is a very powerful way to reconnect and relate with all aspects of ourselves. It is through the practice of unconditional loving that we find that any emptiness or longing we feel within us can be filled with a simple act of giving.\n\nThis ancient ritual is thousands of years old. It was brought to life by those who implemented the practice of breathing life and awareness through the five elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Ether) in offering to the divine within every living being. We will offer fire, incense, roses, water, chocolate and more in adoration and worship of our divine essence.\n\nWe welcome you to reclaim your space and powerful place in the world as we unveil your deepest core. You will leave enchanted having fallen more deeply in love with YOU.\n\nWith open hearts and deep connection you will be \"rebirthed\" from a place of complete vulnerability and fullness as you choose to wake up to YOU!\n\nThis is a non-sxxual experience and welcomes everyone, singles will rotate, and couples may stay together if they want.\n\nLove Exchange: $89 a person\n\nGet your tickets here we often sell out\n\nLIMIT 30 STATIONS\n\nRSVP :\n\nWhat others have said about This Ceremony:\n\n\"Heart opening, will make you cry, have your energy flow through every pore, try it on\"\n\n\"Not knowing what to expect upon entering this illuminated room, I found myself being honored and revered in the most sacred way. I left feeling most loved. Thank you for the gift of myself\"\n\n\"A very supportive group to encourage claiming our full freedom and outrageous loveliness\"\n\n\"Don't ask, just go!! Serenity, grace, and fullness await\"\n\n\"I saw myself as a person capable of loving someone and being loved, realized my mom and dad ARE proud of me, I see in me the person I was always meant to be\"\n\n\"Sending out big hugs to Monique Darling for hosting such a beautiful Ceremony. You know, we all live in a world in which we are over worked and often under-appreciated. This ritual was an opportunity to have one's heart filled up with unconditional love. It was a transformative event, and I highly recommend it to everyone, whether you are woo-woo like me or not. Together we practiced giving and receiving non-sensual adoration. For example, we bathed each other's feet, fed each other chocolate, and showered words of affirmation on each other. We also opened up our hearts to speak vulnerable truths. At one point, we were invited to let go of something we no longer needed. I lit a small candle, and into it I whispered the words, \"I let go of the need to be right.\" And then with one breath, I blew out the flame and let it go!\" ~ Gayle Roberts, San Francisco\n\n\"Wow, the Adoration Ceremony was so much more powerful than I imagined. I arrived nervous, shy, and unsure of what might happen, and I emerged filled with gratitude, radiance, joy, and many new friends. Thank you Monique, for this incredible gift\"\n\n\"Monique's Adoration Ceremony was an experience to remember. Allowing Sacred Space for all to express themselves in whatever ways they needed to heal and come into their own sacred divinity.\"\n\n\"The Art of Adoration Ceremony created a nurturing environment that invited so much release. I feel like parts of my soul have been born again\"\n\nRSVP Here:\n\nWANT MORE? Join Monique, Peter and special guests for all of the yummy events while they‚Äôre in New York...

    "description": "Rope play has the capacity to empower and inspire both the giver and the receiver\n\nRSVP to save your spot:\n\nUnravel. Surrender. Receive.\n\n\"To tie is to embrace.\" - Arisue Go\n\nRope play is a form of sensual bondage. It is an art of connection and seduction, surrender and control, with both ancient roots and modern techniques. Rope play has the capacity to empower and inspire both the giver and the receiver. For the one bound in rope it can at times be paradoxically a very relaxing experience, not unlike swaddling a small baby. At other times being bound, tied, and released can flood the body with endorphins and adrenaline creating highly charged, ecstatic states. For the one doing the tying, rope becomes an extension of his or her hands. It is possible to create almost an infinite number of sensations with rope, from slow and sensual, to rough and biting. By cultivating energetic flow states, a deep sense of connection can develop between rope play partners.\n\nIntimate LEADERSHIP & empowered SURRENDER:\n\nan introductory rope and energy play class.\n\nIt is a small group workshop created for participants desiring a safe and welcoming introduction to ropes while exploring their emotional edges and learning how to confidently take and surrender control.\n\nIn the process, participants will learn about themselves through connection to their deepest and most vulnerable core. After all, it is only by releasing control that we can unleash our full potential, and only by stepping into our power can we invite another to give up theirs.\n\nThrough a combination of tantric practices, sacred sxxuality, and consent- and trauma-informed coaching, this shibari and energetic journey will guide you into an altered state of consciousness that allows for your deepest transformation in confidence, self-acceptance, and sensual expression.\n\nRina will teach a simple, but deceptively powerful style of rope play that require no knowledge of complicated knots. She‚Äôll guide you through the basics of rope safety. She and Monique will offer simple techniques for using rope to cultivate energy and power exchange between consenting adults. Our focus is on using rope as a tool for helping partners develop emotional connection, intimacy, and trust.\n\nNo prior rope play experience is required. Basic energy play or power exchange experience is helpful, but not necessary. Couples and singles of all genders and orientations are welcomed. Uncoupled singles will be paired with other singles. Each participant will learn to tie and be tied. Rope and mats will be provided for those who don‚Äôt already have them.\n\nYou'll learn from two world-class practitioners one, former pro-domme, and the second a tantrika that has led over 3,000 workshops around the world. When you leave, hopefully you will have gained greater access to energy, surrender, play, and also will have gained the skills to practice shibari confidently, safely, and with a greater awareness of your and your partner's emotional needs in intimacy.\n\nLove Exchange $109 single $99 early bird and $169 for pairs\n\nTime 7-10:30 pm\n\nThis is a sensual event, but not sxxual, so bottoms will remain on for this weorkshop. We have several temple parties the weekend before where bottoms can come off ;)\n\nRSVP HERE:\n\nIf you would prefer to pay with Venmo or Paypal please text Monique here 619 601 8852, and she will send you the proper info to pay and register for the event.

My journeys are a dance of technical skills and intuitive flow. Intuitive flow leads the way, while technical skills are ever-present for safe, practical applications.‚Äù\n\nRina is Austin's premier shibari instructor. A former professional dominatrix with twelve years' experience working with elite New York City clients, Rina has now redirected her conscious kink career toward providing vulnerability journeys through rope.\n\nTying together eleven years of tantric bodywork and meditation practices in Asia, Rina studies and performs shibari with the most celebrated masters in Japan and across the United States.\n\nA University of Maryland MBA graduate, certified death doula, and NLP and trauma-informed hypnotherapy practitioner, Rina combines her breadth of knowledge across somatic, spiritual, and sexual disciplines toward an utterly unique shibari modality that invites clients to access their deepest self-discovery and spiritual illumination.\n\nA freediver, BASE jumper, skydiver, student of ancient traditions, and self-described intrepid explorer of consciousness, Rina is also the creator of Underline | World (https://underline.world/), an online tantric immersion course, and appears frequently on podcasts for her work in vulnerability coaching and sacred sexuality.\n\nHer mission is to acquaint you with your own self: raw, unmasked, and intimately tied to your own truth. Please visit Rina's\n\nwebsite (https://www.vulnerabilitycoaching.com/)\n\nto learn more.",
