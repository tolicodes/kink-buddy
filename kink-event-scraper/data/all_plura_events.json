Check out the FAQ on our website (bottom of page)!What is Tantra, and why \"Tantra\" Speed Date?Forget those wild myths and blockbuster misunderstandings; Tantra is more about connection, fun, and being present than anything risqué. Imagine it as the art of \"relationship yoga,\" blending age-old practices with a twist of joy and mindfulness. Through exercises like breathing, meditating, and maybe even a little dancing, you'll find yourself more in tune with those around you. It's like a social superpower for making genuine connections, and trust us, it's a blast! After all, we find this level of presence is exactly what's missing from most dating encounters today. Why just talk when you can laugh, connect, and explore together?What does this style of dating look like?Picture this: You'll form two fun-filled circles of fellow daters. The men make up the outer ring, and the women form the inner ring; so that you're paired off with a friendly face across from you. Together, you'll dive into engaging and heartfelt mini-dates (we call them 'dating stations') that last just long enough to spark a connection. After each experience, you'll bring your hands into a cheerful 'Namaste', share a quick thank you, and then — whoosh! — off to the next exciting meeting. Keep circling around, and by the end, you'll have met everyone.What kinds of exercises will I do?No clichéd icebreakers here! Our exercises are all about authentic human connection, not cheesy romance. We're talking engaging dialogue, light partner yoga, movement/dance, heartwarming eye-gazing, and even some gentle hand-holding. It's a delightful mix that goes beyond the mundane 'what's your job' chatter.The coolest part? Every exercise is wrapped around a positive relating skill. So, not only will you have a blast, you'll be building real relationship skills too! And remember consent, you're the boss of how you participate. It's all about fun and connection in a way that feels good for you.What if one of the exercises is not my cup of tea?Thanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify, or completely opt out. Everyone is encouraged to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators do a fabulous job demonstrating what that looks like, so it feels good for everyone.So how does this all add up to dating?Great question! Think of it as a refreshing twist on the traditional dating scene. You'll get to interact, laugh, and connect with others, and then decide who you'd like to get to know better. We put a fun spin on things by letting the ladies take the lead in choosing; they'll place one of their beads in each man's pouch that they want to connect with. They'll get a feel for the guys' personalities and presence, while the men are guided on how to be grounded and open-hearted. Afterwards, either party can contact the other. It's all about letting connections unfold naturally.What is the schedule?Doors Open: Right at the start time, we'll check you in, hand over your dating materials, and give you a playing card for a super fun Ice Breaker game. You've got until the stations begin to mix and mingle!20 minutes in: Time to let in folks from the waiting list, making sure everything's balanced and ready to roll.30 minutes in: Ice Breaker game wraps up, and the doors close. Now the real fun begins as we kick off the event. Be sure to check in before this time, or you'll miss out on all the excitement! (Running late or need to cancel? Check our policy below.)End of the Night: You'll feel the warm glow of connection and may not want it to end. While we'll gently nudge you toward the door, it's common for guests to join together for dinner, continuing the connections and conversations. Who knows? Your night might just be getting started!What should I wear?Think comfort with a touch of your best self! You'll be sitting and also moving, so choose an outfit that lets you feel relaxed but still sharp. Just remember, it's a date, so grooming matters. And go easy on strong scents; some people are sensitive.Is there food or drink at the event?We usually don't serve food or drinks (unless it's a special event), so feel free to bring a water bottle. Snacks might be good for before or after, but check with the venue, as some don't allow food. As tempting as a quick bite during the event might be, you'll want all your attention on your dates. And remember, alcohol is a no-go, so please arrive with a clear and ready mind.How many dates will I have?Get ready for a lively evening with up to 20 opportunities to connect! Our events typically max out at around 40 singles. Assuming a balanced mix, you'll have the chance to spark a connection with up to 20 different people. And, we're all about quality not quantity. You'll find each moment meaningful as you dive into engaging exchanges with others who, just like you, are looking to explore connection and authenticity.What is the gender balance at the event?We don't believe in leaving anyone out of the fun, so we do our best to aim for an equal gender balance. Of course, it isn't always 100% under our control--even our matchmaking powers have their limits. But so far, just about every event has been sold out. And since we have an equal number of tickets per gender, they've all had a solid mix of singles ready to mingle! (We also occasionally use door sales magic to balance the gender too.)What if I don't match with anyone?As many of our attendees say, \"I don't even care if I match with anyone, this was amazing!\" That said, we geek out on data. Our statistics say there is a 94.09% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if for whatever reason the probability fails you, we've got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!What is the age range?Some events have a suggested age range (noted in the title and description) and some are open to all ages. Whether you're a little outside the range or just curious about meeting people within it, you're welcome here.Our most popular events are open to all ages, drawing a vibrant and diverse crowd. Singles 30-45 tend to be the largest group. Followed by folks 45+ and then 20s. And while age might be a curiosity, what truly sets our events apart is the connection experience.But here's the thing. It's more than just about the dates. And this is what makes Tantra Speed Date® unique. Singles everywhere rave about how the experience itself can be quite transformative, regardless of their matches. Why? Simply engaging consciously with other singles in a positive and structured way promotes more healthy relationships. And it just plain feels good to connect with real people. You likely have never experienced dating in such a fun and comfortable way. You'll gain confidence, pick up new skills, and will likely start to attract more quality people into your life. That's what our participants say over and over again!Will there be enough people?Don't let low RSVPs in one spot fool you. Our events often sell out faster than you can say \"Namaste,\" and often with a waiting list. We're keen to promote across various platforms, and they don't all show the same love. Rest assured, we make sure there's always a crowd worth your while. So come on down; your next amazing connection could be just one RSVP away!Do I have to be single to attend?Ah, the modern relationship landscape—a tapestry of statuses! While you don't need to be 'single' in the traditional sense, you do need to be in a space where romantic connections are possible. If you're already committed and not open to new love, you may want to consider our couples events. But if you find your heart's door ajar, even just a smidge—or if you're teetering on the edge of 'ready to date'—this could be the perfect space to explore what's possible. Consider this your invitation to a playground of connection, perfect for testing the waters!Is this a heterosexual event and is there a Queer/LGBTQ Tantra Speed Date?Diversity is the spice of life, and we're cooking up all kinds of flavors! This classic version of Tantra Speed Date® is primarily designed for men-seeking-women and women-seeking-men. In this setup you'll find yourself in one of two gendered circles—one for men and one for women. You'll rotate through up to 20 dates with members of the opposite gender. But don't fret, fabulous queer friends! We also host Queer Tantra Speed Date events in select cities. So if you're looking for a rainbow connection, keep an eye on our website to see when we're bringing that magic to a city near you!What is your cancellation/refund policy?We get it—life's a whirlwind! If you find yourself having to back out, no worries. Here's the lowdown: cancel 24 hours or more ahead and you'll get a refund or transfer, no fuss. If you're within that 24-hour window, or fashionably late and miss the opening ceremony, shoot us an email and we'll graciously \"speed date\" your ticket to the next event as a one-time courtesy. So keep your plans as flexible as a yoga pose, and communicate with us before the event kicks off. No refunds or transfers after the chimes ring and the magic starts!Can I sign up with my friend?Absolutely! We often have Bring-A-Friend ticket discounts! So thanks for sharing Tantra Speed Date® with your friends! However, do be sure to fill out their name and their email address on the attendee form. Otherwise we will not be able to check them in properly, and they will not receive all the wonderful matches they'll make at the event. If we had a nickel for how many times your friends email us wondering where their matches went... well, you get the picture. So please. Do your friends a solid and fill in their proper details.More Questions?Contact us at help@tantrany.com we'll be happy to tell you more about this event or others.",

If anyone ever makes you feel unsafe at our events, please reach out to our staff.Our events are at a dedicated venue at Prime Produce Co-op and are graciously hosted by PLAN Gaming (https://www.plangaming.org/), which is a non-profit incubator.

We encourage you to dress like the goddesses you are and prepare for a night of indulgence. We’re committed to creating a safe and welcoming space to facilitate new relationships, exploration, and fulfillment of desires! Good vibes only — or else! ;)Who Can AttendSAPPHICS (21+). If you do not fit the below definition, please do not come. This is meant to be an intentional space for sapphics to meet other sapphics. For everyone else, there are other Pagans Paradise events that you’ll love. Obviously, enforcing this policy is tricky, but we will trust attendees to respect our space and our intentions.(Definition from LGBTQIA+ Wiki) Sapphic, sometimes known as women loving women (WLW),or sapphist, refers to a woman or woman-aligned person of any sexual orientation who is attracted to women or woman aligned genders/gender identities. We mean to be specifically inclusive of non-binary people. It is an umbrella term for many identities, including those who are lesbian, pansexual, bisexual, or queer. It is used to promote solidarity among women and non-binary people of all identities who are attracted to those who are women and woman-aligned. It may also be used as an identity, and may be found particularly useful for individuals who know they are attracted to women but may be uncertain if they are attracted to other genders. It can also be used to describe a relationship between two women.Ultimately, we reserve the right to remove anyone, sapphic or not, for any reason - this is usually a last resort consequence of a breach of our Community Guidelines. Please respect this privileged space and treat it as your own home.The Night will feature:Orientation: Nix, our host, will review guidelines about consent &amp; mutual desire to ensure we’re all on the same page and will respect this privileged safe space. We’ll also explain the different rooms, play stations, and group activities throughout the night.Icebreakers: To facilitate new friendships and manifest fantasies, attendees will give a brief introduction including name, pronouns, and speak out loud any desires for the night. Note - this does not guarantee that your dreams will come true - and we discourage transactional Desperate D*ck/Predatory P*ssy energy! … but wishing out loud increases the chances of magic happening!A spectacular performance by burlesque queen Rita-n-Wink!

Check out the FAQ on our website (bottom of page)!What is Tantra, and why \"Tantra\" Speed Date?Forget those wild myths and blockbuster misunderstandings; Tantra is more about connection, fun, and being present than anything risqué. Imagine it as the art of \"relationship yoga,\" blending age-old practices with a twist of joy and mindfulness. Through exercises like breathing, meditating, and maybe even a little dancing, you'll find yourself more in tune with those around you. It's like a social superpower for making genuine connections, and trust us, it's a blast! After all, we find this level of presence is exactly what's missing from most dating encounters today. Why just talk when you can laugh, connect, and explore together?What does this style of dating look like?Picture this: You'll form two fun-filled circles of fellow daters. The men make up the outer ring, and the women form the inner ring; so that you're paired off with a friendly face across from you. Together, you'll dive into engaging and heartfelt mini-dates (we call them 'dating stations') that last just long enough to spark a connection. After each experience, you'll bring your hands into a cheerful 'Namaste', share a quick thank you, and then — whoosh! — off to the next exciting meeting. Keep circling around, and by the end, you'll have met everyone.What kinds of exercises will I do?No clichéd icebreakers here! Our exercises are all about authentic human connection, not cheesy romance. We're talking engaging dialogue, light partner yoga, movement/dance, heartwarming eye-gazing, and even some gentle hand-holding. It's a delightful mix that goes beyond the mundane 'what's your job' chatter.The coolest part? Every exercise is wrapped around a positive relating skill. So, not only will you have a blast, you'll be building real relationship skills too! And remember consent, you're the boss of how you participate. It's all about fun and connection in a way that feels good for you.What if one of the exercises is not my cup of tea?Thanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify, or completely opt out. Everyone is encouraged to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators do a fabulous job demonstrating what that looks like, so it feels good for everyone.So how does this all add up to dating?Great question! Think of it as a refreshing twist on the traditional dating scene. You'll get to interact, laugh, and connect with others, and then decide who you'd like to get to know better. We put a fun spin on things by letting the ladies take the lead in choosing; they'll place one of their beads in each man's pouch that they want to connect with. They'll get a feel for the guys' personalities and presence, while the men are guided on how to be grounded and open-hearted. Afterwards, either party can contact the other. It's all about letting connections unfold naturally.What is the schedule?Doors Open: Right at the start time, we'll check you in, hand over your dating materials, and give you a playing card for a super fun Ice Breaker game. You've got until the stations begin to mix and mingle!20 minutes in: Time to let in folks from the waiting list, making sure everything's balanced and ready to roll.30 minutes in: Ice Breaker game wraps up, and the doors close. Now the real fun begins as we kick off the event. Be sure to check in before this time, or you'll miss out on all the excitement! (Running late or need to cancel? Check our policy below.)End of the Night: You'll feel the warm glow of connection and may not want it to end. While we'll gently nudge you toward the door, it's common for guests to join together for dinner, continuing the connections and conversations. Who knows? Your night might just be getting started!What should I wear?Think comfort with a touch of your best self! You'll be sitting and also moving, so choose an outfit that lets you feel relaxed but still sharp. Just remember, it's a date, so grooming matters. And go easy on strong scents; some people are sensitive.Is there food or drink at the event?We usually don't serve food or drinks (unless it's a special event), so feel free to bring a water bottle. Snacks might be good for before or after, but check with the venue, as some don't allow food. As tempting as a quick bite during the event might be, you'll want all your attention on your dates. And remember, alcohol is a no-go, so please arrive with a clear and ready mind.How many dates will I have?Get ready for a lively evening with up to 20 opportunities to connect! Our events typically max out at around 40 singles. Assuming a balanced mix, you'll have the chance to spark a connection with up to 20 different people. And, we're all about quality not quantity. You'll find each moment meaningful as you dive into engaging exchanges with others who, just like you, are looking to explore connection and authenticity.What is the gender balance at the event?We don't believe in leaving anyone out of the fun, so we do our best to aim for an equal gender balance. Of course, it isn't always 100% under our control--even our matchmaking powers have their limits. But so far, just about every event has been sold out. And since we have an equal number of tickets per gender, they've all had a solid mix of singles ready to mingle! (We also occasionally use door sales magic to balance the gender too.)What if I don't match with anyone?As many of our attendees say, \"I don't even care if I match with anyone, this was amazing!\" That said, we geek out on data. Our statistics say there is a 94.09% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if for whatever reason the probability fails you, we've got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!What is the age range?Some events have a suggested age range (noted in the title and description) and some are open to all ages. Whether you're a little outside the range or just curious about meeting people within it, you're welcome here.Our most popular events are open to all ages, drawing a vibrant and diverse crowd. Singles 30-45 tend to be the largest group. Followed by folks 45+ and then 20s. And while age might be a curiosity, what truly sets our events apart is the connection experience.But here's the thing. It's more than just about the dates. And this is what makes Tantra Speed Date® unique. Singles everywhere rave about how the experience itself can be quite transformative, regardless of their matches. Why? Simply engaging consciously with other singles in a positive and structured way promotes more healthy relationships. And it just plain feels good to connect with real people. You likely have never experienced dating in such a fun and comfortable way. You'll gain confidence, pick up new skills, and will likely start to attract more quality people into your life. That's what our participants say over and over again!Will there be enough people?Don't let low RSVPs in one spot fool you. Our events often sell out faster than you can say \"Namaste,\" and often with a waiting list. We're keen to promote across various platforms, and they don't all show the same love. Rest assured, we make sure there's always a crowd worth your while. So come on down; your next amazing connection could be just one RSVP away!Do I have to be single to attend?Ah, the modern relationship landscape—a tapestry of statuses! While you don't need to be 'single' in the traditional sense, you do need to be in a space where romantic connections are possible. If you're already committed and not open to new love, you may want to consider our couples events. But if you find your heart's door ajar, even just a smidge—or if you're teetering on the edge of 'ready to date'—this could be the perfect space to explore what's possible. Consider this your invitation to a playground of connection, perfect for testing the waters!Is this a heterosexual event and is there a Queer/LGBTQ Tantra Speed Date?Diversity is the spice of life, and we're cooking up all kinds of flavors! This classic version of Tantra Speed Date® is primarily designed for men-seeking-women and women-seeking-men. In this setup you'll find yourself in one of two gendered circles—one for men and one for women. You'll rotate through up to 20 dates with members of the opposite gender. But don't fret, fabulous queer friends! We also host Queer Tantra Speed Date events in select cities. So if you're looking for a rainbow connection, keep an eye on our website to see when we're bringing that magic to a city near you!What is your cancellation/refund policy?We get it—life's a whirlwind! If you find yourself having to back out, no worries. Here's the lowdown: cancel 24 hours or more ahead and you'll get a refund or transfer, no fuss. If you're within that 24-hour window, or fashionably late and miss the opening ceremony, shoot us an email and we'll graciously \"speed date\" your ticket to the next event as a one-time courtesy. So keep your plans as flexible as a yoga pose, and communicate with us before the event kicks off. No refunds or transfers after the chimes ring and the magic starts!Can I sign up with my friend?Absolutely! We often have Bring-A-Friend ticket discounts! So thanks for sharing Tantra Speed Date® with your friends! However, do be sure to fill out their name and their email address on the attendee form. Otherwise we will not be able to check them in properly, and they will not receive all the wonderful matches they'll make at the event. If we had a nickel for how many times your friends email us wondering where their matches went... well, you get the picture. So please. Do your friends a solid and fill in their proper details.More Questions?Contact us at help@tantrany.com we'll be happy to tell you more about this event or others.",

For everyone else, there are other Pagans Paradise events that you’ll love. Obviously, enforcing this policy is tricky, but we will trust attendees to respect our space and our intentions.(Definition from LGBTQIA+ Wiki) Sapphic, sometimes known as women loving women (WLW),or sapphist, refers to a woman or woman-aligned person of any sexual orientation who is attracted to women or woman aligned genders/gender identities. We mean to be specifically inclusive of non-binary people. It is an umbrella term for many identities, including those who are lesbian, pansexual, bisexual, or queer. It is used to promote solidarity among women and non-binary people of all identities who are attracted to those who are women and woman-aligned. It may also be used as an identity, and may be found particularly useful for individuals who know they are attracted to women but may be uncertain if they are attracted to other genders. It can also be used to describe a relationship between two women.Ultimately, we reserve the right to remove anyone, sapphic or not, for any reason - this is usually a last resort consequence of a breach of our Community Guidelines. Please respect this privileged space and treat it as your own home.The Night will feature:Orientation: Nix, our host, will review guidelines about consent &amp; mutual desire to ensure we’re all on the same page and will respect this privileged safe space.

A beautiful and sacred ancient ritual that has been practiced for thousands of years.It is a beautiful ceremony of honoring and adoring the Divine that dwells within each of us, and brings us into a profound space of connection and universal Love.This experience welcomes everyone, all faiths, and orientations.View the image gallery under the Discussion tab to get an idea what the experience will be like. (Pics and Videos from the last one)Step into a world of acceptance and sensation where all of you is welcome. Each person is invited into magical connections to expand your experience/capacity of giving and receiving. The ritual begins the moment you enter as you are celebrated, seen and adored for ALL you are.This evening’s ceremony is dedicated to all genders. In fact, participants will not know whether they will be in the giving or receiving role until they arrive. We will use movement, sound and the five elements, all given to us with ample instruction, enriching each experience throughout the evening. You may find yourself turning inwards and becoming aware of abundant love and innate beauty that is part of your being.This ceremony opens people's hearts in a way that allows them to see the inner beauty and the Divine within us all. The participants in the giving role will be instructed in performing an ancient ritual, which is simple in form yet very powerful in practice. As the participants in the receiving role accept the offerings and adoration, they in turn connect with unconditional love and reflect that adoration back to the givers with their presence. Taking part in these rituals is a very powerful way to reconnect and relate with all aspects of ourselves. It is through the practice of unconditional loving that we find that any emptiness or longing we feel within us can be filled with a simple act of giving.This ancient ritual is thousands of years old. It was brought to life by those who implemented the practice of breathing life and awareness through the five elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Ether) in offering to the divine within every living being. We will offer fire, incense, roses, water, chocolate and more in adoration and worship of our divine essence.We welcome you to reclaim your space and powerful place in the world as we unveil your deepest core. You will leave enchanted having fallen more deeply in love with YOU.With open hearts and deep connection you will be \"rebirthed\" from a place of complete vulnerability and fullness as you choose to wake up to YOU!This is a non-sxxual experience and welcomes everyone, singles will rotate, and couples may stay together if they want.Love Exchange: $89 a personGet your tickets here we often sell outLIMIT 30 STATIONSRSVP :What others have said about This Ceremony:\"Heart opening, will make you cry, have your energy flow through every pore, try it on\"\"Not knowing what to expect upon entering this illuminated room, I found myself being honored and revered in the most sacred way. I left feeling most loved. Thank you for the gift of myself\"\"A very supportive group to encourage claiming our full freedom and outrageous loveliness\"\"Don't ask, just go!! Serenity, grace, and fullness await\"\"I saw myself as a person capable of loving someone and being loved, realized my mom and dad ARE proud of me, I see in me the person I was always meant to be\"\"Sending out big hugs to Monique Darling for hosting such a beautiful Ceremony. You know, we all live in a world in which we are over worked and often under-appreciated. This ritual was an opportunity to have one's heart filled up with unconditional love. It was a transformative event, and I highly recommend it to everyone, whether you are woo-woo like me or not. Together we practiced giving and receiving non-sensual adoration. For example, we bathed each other's feet, fed each other chocolate, and showered words of affirmation on each other. We also opened up our hearts to speak vulnerable truths. At one point, we were invited to let go of something we no longer needed. I lit a small candle, and into it I whispered the words, \"I let go of the need to be right.\" And then with one breath, I blew out the flame and let it go!\" ~ Gayle Roberts, San Francisco\"Wow, the Adoration Ceremony was so much more powerful than I imagined. I arrived nervous, shy, and unsure of what might happen, and I emerged filled with gratitude, radiance, joy, and many new friends. Thank you Monique, for this incredible gift\"\"Monique's Adoration Ceremony was an experience to remember. Allowing Sacred Space for all to express themselves in whatever ways they needed to heal and come into their own sacred divinity.\"\"The Art of Adoration Ceremony created a nurturing environment that invited so much release. I feel like parts of my soul have been born again\"RSVP Here:WANT MORE? Join Monique, Peter and special guests for all of the yummy events while they’re in New York...

    "summary": "Rope play has the capacity to empower and inspire both the giver and the receiverRSVP to save your spot:Unravel. Surrender. Receive.\"To tie is to embrace.\" - Arisue GoRope play is a form of sensual bondage. It is an art of connection and seduction, surrender and control, with both ancient roots and modern techniques. Rope play has the capacity to empower and inspire both the giver and the receiver. For the one bound in rope it can at times be paradoxically a very relaxing experience, not unlike swaddling a small baby. At other times being bound, tied, and released can flood the body with endorphins and adrenaline creating highly charged, ecstatic states. For the one doing the tying, rope becomes an extension of his or her hands. It is possible to create almost an infinite number of sensations with rope, from slow and sensual, to rough and biting. By cultivating energetic flow states, a deep sense of connection can develop between rope play partners.Intimate LEADERSHIP &amp; empowered SURRENDER:an introductory rope and energy play class.It is a small group workshop created for participants desiring a safe and welcoming introduction to ropes while exploring their emotional edges and learning how to confidently take and surrender control.In the process, participants will learn about themselves through connection to their deepest and most vulnerable core. After all, it is only by releasing control that we can unleash our full potential, and only by stepping into our power can we invite another to give up theirs.Through a combination of tantric practices, sacred sxxuality, and consent- and trauma-informed coaching, this shibari and energetic journey will guide you into an altered state of consciousness that allows for your deepest transformation in confidence, self-acceptance, and sensual expression.Rina will teach a simple, but deceptively powerful style of rope play that require no knowledge of complicated knots. She’ll guide you through the basics of rope safety. She and Monique will offer simple techniques for using rope to cultivate energy and power exchange between consenting adults. Our focus is on using rope as a tool for helping partners develop emotional connection, intimacy, and trust.No prior rope play experience is required. Basic energy play or power exchange experience is helpful, but not necessary. Couples and singles of all genders and orientations are welcomed. Uncoupled singles will be paired with other singles. Each participant will learn to tie and be tied. Rope and mats will be provided for those who don’t already have them.You'll learn from two world-class practitioners one, former pro-domme, and the second a tantrika that has led over 3,000 workshops around the world. When you leave, hopefully you will have gained greater access to energy, surrender, play, and also will have gained the skills to practice shibari confidently, safely, and with a greater awareness of your and your partner's emotional needs in intimacy.Love Exchange $109 single $99 early bird and $169 for pairsTime 7-10:30 pmThis is a sensual event, but not sxxual, so bottoms will remain on for this weorkshop.

Instead of leaving you to your guesses and assumptions, I will try to clarify what a shibari journey with me really is. My agenda is to offer a SACRED JOURNEY INTO VULNERABILITY. My journeys are a dance of technical skills and intuitive flow. Intuitive flow leads the way, while technical skills are ever-present for safe, practical applications.”Rina is Austin's premier shibari instructor. A former professional dominatrix with twelve years' experience working with elite New York City clients, Rina has now redirected her conscious kink career toward providing vulnerability journeys through rope.Tying together eleven years of tantric bodywork and meditation practices in Asia, Rina studies and performs shibari with the most celebrated masters in Japan and across the United States.A University of Maryland MBA graduate, certified death doula, and NLP and trauma-informed hypnotherapy practitioner, Rina combines her breadth of knowledge across somatic, spiritual, and sexual disciplines toward an utterly unique shibari modality that invites clients to access their deepest self-discovery and spiritual illumination.A freediver, BASE jumper, skydiver, student of ancient traditions, and self-described intrepid explorer of consciousness, Rina is also the creator of Underline | World (https://underline.world/), an online tantric immersion course, and appears frequently on podcasts for her work in vulnerability coaching and sacred sexuality.Her mission is to acquaint you with your own self: raw, unmasked, and intimately tied to your own truth.
