The event has many aspects: philosophy, consent & communication practice, self-care extravaganza, many-handed healing touch opportunities, slow-motion contact dance, and more.\n\nOur vision is to create touch-positive communities here in NYC and around THE WORLD! We require everyone to first attend the “Welcome Mush” to get oriented around community values, agreements and all the other tools & skills we need to cuddle safely together 💛\n\nSee the Agenda for the Welcome Mush below 😊\n\n· 6:30 - 7:00 – Welcome Period (Doors Open)\n· 7:00 - 7:20 – Opening Circle (Group Sharing, What is the Mush?)\n· 7:20 - 8:00 – Sharing & Practicing Community Agreements\n· 8:00 - 8:30 – Consent & Communication Exercises\n· 8:30 - 9:00 – Creating THE MOST INCLUSIVE cuddle puddle on earth (aka the Mush, as seen above!)\n· 9:00 - 10:00 – Open Mush Time\n· 10:00 - 10:20 – Closing Circle (Group Sharing & Integration)\n\nThis is a place to open your heart and experience love and acceptance from the whole community 💖 We will revel in the beauty of touch, healthy boundaries, subtle non-verbal communication, and exploring the connection of human bodies in an explicitly non-sexual container. We also ask that everyone comes in a state of sobriety and sensitivity that supports full awareness of their own and others' boundaries.\n\nTo create a safe container for this exploration, it's only possible to join the event and receive the location if you agree to honor the Community Agreements and complete a short questionnaire. These agreements support the core values of the Mush: Safety, Love, Authenticity and Autonomy. Please review the Community Agreements and complete the questionnaire at https://forms.gle/DtujR8z4jZezjzyA8 . We’ll also be discussing and practicing the agreements during the event 😊\n\n· Doors open at 6:30 pm, Opening Circle starts at 7:00 pm, Doors close at 7:20 pm\n· Wear comfy clothing that helps you feel relaxed\n· Some snacks will be provided and you’re welcome to bring snacks to share with the group \n\nJoin us for an evening where every touch is an expression of kindness and every interaction is a step towards deeper connection. We would love to see you there 💛\n\nWe will never turn someone away due to lack of funds. If cost is an issue, work exchange in support of the event is possible. Please reach out to themushcommunity@gmail.com .\n\nAbout the Facilitator:\n\nMihir Shah first discovered the Mush on the island of Koh Phangan, Thailand. Never having heard of “cuddle parties” before 🤔, he was nervous, but curious about what the experience could be like. After that first event, he fell in love with the community, values and agreements of this touch-positive space. He loved it so much that he attended the Mush Movement Facilitator Training hosted by Mush Movement Founder Davi Rhein. Now, Mihir is committed to share the experience of the Mush in NYC.

Red Tents are spaces for women to share their stories, rest and gain strength from being together and supporting one another.\n\nThese spaces can take many forms but essentially they are:\n🌹 women meeting and holding a circle where each\n🌹 woman gets time and space to speak without discussion or debate;\n🌹 women meeting regularly at an agreed time and place;\n🌹 gatherings which are either free or donation-based to cover room hire or tea\n🌹 circles which respond to the wishes of those present rather than primarily running workshops, trainings or any deliberate kind of personal development.*\n\n*description from https://redtentdirectory.com/\n\nIt’s time to build a community here in NY for a donation based safe, nourishing space for monthly gatherings and ongoing networking and support. I’ve been learning from women around the world of how they hold and host these spaces and so glad to be sharing here. If anyone is interested in getting more involved in cocreating as it grows please reach out as well.\n\nSuggested donation $10 to confirm your spot but you are fully welcome, if this is a hardship please do still come xx\n\nHope to see you :)",

And is fun, healing, and unusually alive. You are welcome. \n\n\nHosted by Rob Kancler and Michael Fleit, who each come with many years of dedicated investigation of embodiment and self.\n\n\nSuggested Donation: $20-50, RVSP and completed Venmo @Robert-Kancler needed to register.\n\nPS - Arrival/soft start 1:30p, door close and we’ll begin at 2:00.\n\nPPS - Here's some info about the container, to give you a better sense of what this is and how it's held:\n\nSeven Agreements -  These are firm. If you agree with them, welcome to the space.\n1 - Confidentiality. \n2- Honor yourself. Trust your knowing of your limits. Take responsibility for yourself and your needs.\nThere is a STOP lever on the train.\n3 - Honor others. Be kind and respectful.\n4 - Don’t try to save or fix. Don’t give advice. Don’t assume someone is asking for help because they share, or need anything because they are visibly emotional.\n5 - Practice Responsibility. Own your experience 100% and allow others to do the same. Speak from the “I”. Own your assumptions. Own your stories.\n6 - No gossip. Don’t speak disparagingly about anyone who is not present. Don’t reveal personal information about anyone who is not present.\n7 - We agree to stay until the end.\n\n\nSeven Suggestions - Invitations for our time together.\n1 - Be all in. Play full out. Your full participation will serve the most rich experience for yourself and the collective.\n2 - Attunement. Practice deep listening. Sense in whether who may be one to carry the collective unfolding in each moment and the next. Beware of hijacking. Try to track where the most energy is rather than whats the latest or the loudest. \n3 - Authenticity. Reveal, don’t conceal. Don’t withhold authentic expression to manage your reputation, the feelings of others, or to be “nice” or “polite”.\n4 - Play outside of your regular comfort zone. The discomfort of vulnerability and venturing into the unknown is often just before the good stuff.\n5 - Be curious. Approach things with an open mind and heart. Seek to see the humanity in others. Understand where you do not is more likely a reflection of yourself than anything about them.\n6 - We’re in this together. This is an interconnected collective experience which extends beyond being a separate individual. Be fully present when others are sharing or getting support. They are you and may be an “asset” and exactly what you’d most benefit from being present with.\n7 - Enjoy. Play. Have fun.",

Arrive early to land!\n\nPPS - Here's some info about the container, to give you a better sense of what this is and how it's held:\n\nSeven Agreements - These are firm. If you agree with them, welcome to the space.\n1 - Confidentiality.\n2- Honor yourself. Trust your knowing of your limits. Take responsibility for yourself and your needs.\nThere is a STOP lever on the train.\n3 - Honor others. Be kind and respectful.\n4 - Don’t try to save or fix. Don’t give advice. Don’t assume someone is asking for help because they share, or need anything because they are visibly emotional.\n5 - Practice Responsibility. Own your experience 100% and allow others to do the same. Speak from the “I”. Own your assumptions. Own your stories.\n6 - No gossip. Don’t speak disparagingly about anyone who is not present. Don’t reveal personal information about anyone who is not present.\n7 - We agree to stay until the end.\n\n\nSeven Suggestions - Invitations for our time together.\n1 - Be all in. Play full out. Your full participation will serve the most rich experience for yourself and the collective.\n2 - Attunement. Practice deep listening. Sense in whether who may be one to carry the collective unfolding in each moment and the next. Beware of hijacking. Try to track where the most energy is rather than whats the latest or the loudest.\n3 - Authenticity. Reveal, don’t conceal. Don’t withhold authentic expression to manage your reputation, the feelings of others, or to be “nice” or “polite”.\n4 - Play outside of your regular comfort zone. The discomfort of vulnerability and venturing into the unknown is often just before the good stuff.\n5 - Be curious. Approach things with an open mind and heart. Seek to see the humanity in others. Understand where you do not is more likely a reflection of yourself than anything about them.\n6 - We’re in this together. This is an interconnected collective experience which extends beyond being a separate individual. Be fully present when others are sharing or getting support. They are you and may be an “asset” and exactly what you’d most benefit from being present with.\n7 - Enjoy. Play. Have fun.",

The event has many aspects: philosophy, consent & communication practice, self-care extravaganza, many-handed healing touch opportunities, slow-motion contact dance, and more.\n\nOur vision is to create touch-positive communities here in NYC and around THE WORLD! We require everyone to first attend the “Welcome Mush” to get oriented around community values, agreements and all the other tools & skills we need to cuddle safely together 💛\n\nSee the Agenda for the Welcome Mush below 😊\n\n· 6:30 - 7:00 – Welcome Period (Doors Open)\n· 7:00 - 7:20 – Opening Circle (Group Sharing, What is the Mush?)\n· 7:20 - 8:00 – Sharing & Practicing Community Agreements\n· 8:00 - 8:30 – Consent & Communication Exercises\n· 8:30 - 9:00 – Creating THE MOST INCLUSIVE cuddle puddle on earth (aka the Mush, as seen above!)\n· 9:00 - 10:00 – Open Mush Time\n· 10:00 - 10:20 – Closing Circle (Group Sharing & Integration)\n\nAssuming you successfully complete the Welcome Mush and demonstrate you have a good understanding of the skills needed to safely navigate the space, you’ll be able to cuddle freely at future events with other people that have completed the Welcome Mush!\n\nThis is a place to open your heart and experience love and acceptance from the whole community 💖 We will revel in the beauty of touch, healthy boundaries, subtle non-verbal communication, and exploring the connection of human bodies in an explicitly non-sexual container. We also ask that everyone comes in a state of sobriety and sensitivity that supports full awareness of their own and others' boundaries.\n\nTo create a safe container for this exploration, it's only possible to join the event and receive the location if you agree to honor the Community Agreements and complete a short questionnaire.

Never having heard of “cuddle parties” before 🤔, he was nervous, but curious about what the experience could be like. After that first event, he fell in love with the community, values and agreements of this touch-positive space. He loved it so much that he attended the Mush Movement Facilitator Training hosted by Mush Movement Founder Davi Rhein. Now, Mihir is committed to share the experience of the Mush in NYC.
